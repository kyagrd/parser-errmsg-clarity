Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge.

Error message:
expected '.' after declaration

Code:
```
INT x = 5 INT y = 6.
```

Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block.
Note that the syntax of the code above may be different from C-like languages.
So do not fix the code assuming it is a C-like language,
unless you are very sure from the error message and the code above is actually a C-like syntax.
Especialliy, do not use semicolons to fix the error message unless the error message suggests to do it.
