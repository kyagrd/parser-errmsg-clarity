Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge.

Error message:
syntax error

Code:
```
int x = 5 int y = 6#
```

Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block.
Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from C-like languages.
So do not fix the code assuming it is a C-like language, unless you are
very sure, from the error message and the code above, it is actually
a C-like syntax. Make MINIMAL CHANGES to the code to fix the syntax error
and make it a TOP PRIOROTY to use the information of the the error message.
FIRST try to fix the error only using symbols that either directly appear
or suggested in the error message.
VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE symbols from C-like syntax to fix the syntax error
unless it is suggested by the error message, or you have high confidence that
the syntax of the code is definitively C-like.
