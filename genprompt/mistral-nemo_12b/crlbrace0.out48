```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
The error in the original code was that there was no `:` after the closing parenthesis of the conditional statement, and the second condition had no opening bracket `{`. The corrected version includes the missing `:` after the closing parenthesis and adds an opening bracket `{` before the second condition.
