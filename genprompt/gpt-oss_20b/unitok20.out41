Thinking...
We have a user message: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." There's an error message: "syntax error". Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The note: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

Error message: "syntax error". Contains "syntax" and "error". But we need to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message "syntax error" contains no symbols except letters and space. So perhaps we need to use the error message string "syntax error" as a hint. But it's unclear. The code uses some unusual brackets 《 》 and 》.

Maybe the error is that the code uses mismatched brackets. We need to fix it by replacing 《 with < and 》 with > or similar. But we are told not to use pre-trained knowledge, just use symbols from error message. But error message has no symbols.

Wait, maybe the instruction is ambiguous: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message "syntax error" is what we get from a parser, but we can't use knowledge of languages. So maybe we have to output the code unchanged because we can't deduce anything.

But the example says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains "syntax error". No symbols. So maybe we can't use any symbol to correct.

Thus maybe we output the code as is, but with a comment? Hmm.

Let's consider that the code uses some unusual bracket characters: 《 and 》. Possibly they are mismatched: There's an extra 》 at the end? Code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The opening 《 matches a closing 》 after a=1; then else b = 2; 》 maybe mismatched. So maybe we should close the if with 》. Actually we might need to remove the last 》. Or perhaps the proper syntax uses parentheses: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } But we can't use braces.

But instructions: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages." So maybe we treat 《 as an opening delimiter and 》 as closing. Then we need to pair them. The code has two opening 《? Actually only one at start. It has two 》? Actually code: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》 . There's a 》 after a=1; then else b=2; then a final 》. So maybe the else block is not wrapped. So we need to wrap else block inside another pair of 《 》? Perhaps we need: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That would make sense. So the fixed code would be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Yes. That uses same symbols. That might fix the syntax error.

Thus final answer: inside triple backquotes, we output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
