Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code uses unusual brackets 《 and 》. The error message just says syntax error. We need to use only error message symbols? The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on knowledge of programming languages. We have to fix using symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message is "syntax error". So we only have words "syntax" and "error". But we cannot use them to fix code? It says use symbols that appear in error message, if available. But error message has no symbols, just letters. So maybe we need to produce the same code but with some adjustment. The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. Probably they intend to use brackets like `<` and `>` but replaced with 《 and 》. The syntax error arises because those are not recognized. So we need to replace them with normal parentheses or braces. So we can fix to: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or maybe the syntax is expecting something else. But we can choose typical braces. The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we can guess that `if` uses parentheses after the condition, and the code block uses 《 and 》 but that's wrong. So we can replace with something like `{}`. So the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
