Thinking...
We have an error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The syntax uses Chinese quotation marks 《 and 》 maybe as block delimiters. The error says after else clause, unexpected '》', implying the else clause is closed before the closing 》 for the whole if statement. The if statement already closed, so the outer closing 》 should be removed or repositioned.

We need to fix code to remove unexpected 》 after else clause. We have to use only symbols in the error message: '》' appears, maybe we keep outer brackets but adjust. Maybe use matching pair: The if block: "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》" then else "b = 2;". But there is extra outer 》. So we can remove the last 》. But code requires outer 》? Let's rewrite:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

That would close if block then else. But perhaps we need outer 》 to close else? The error says after else clause unexpected '》', so remove last 》. So final code: "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;". Provide inside triple backticks.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
