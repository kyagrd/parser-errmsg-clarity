Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message is just "syntax error". They give code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to produce only the fixed code in triple backquotes. So need to find what syntax is wrong. It seems like they used @ incorrectly. They want an if statement. Maybe they want `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. They also used '#' comment incorrectly maybe. The original is weird: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". They likely want to correct to something like:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Given instruction: use ONLY the error message, which is "syntax error". That seems contradictory: they want to fix syntax, but can't use pre-trained knowledge. But we can assume we need to produce a corrected code.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
