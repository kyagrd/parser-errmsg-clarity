Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message? That's odd. But essentially, we just need to output corrected code. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax. The correct syntax in many languages: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So fix brackets. Also remove stray `]` at end. So final:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to output only that inside triple backquotes. Let's do.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
