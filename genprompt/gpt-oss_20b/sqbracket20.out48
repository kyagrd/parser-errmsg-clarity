Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. The error message is just "syntax error". So we must infer from the code. The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Looks like mismatched brackets. It uses [ ] but after else uses b = 2; ] missing [ before else block? Should be if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ] maybe. Also stray ] at end. So fix: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. That matches brackets. Also remove extra ] at end. So final code: inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
