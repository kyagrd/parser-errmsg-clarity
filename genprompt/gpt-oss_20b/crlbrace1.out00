Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code has syntax error: '}' after else clause. The correct code likely:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But we need to use only error message. The error message says: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the error is the stray '}'. So we need to remove that extra '}'. So correct code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But maybe also we need braces around else? But not required. The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the only fix is to remove the extra '}'. So final code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Let's output that in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
