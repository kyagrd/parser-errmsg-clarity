Thinking...
We have error message: syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to fix syntax error. The code looks like C-like. There's an extra closing brace '}'. Also missing braces for else. Perhaps we need to add braces or remove extra bracket.

We can fix by removing the stray '}' at the end, and adding braces for else if needed. The code currently: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This would fix the syntax: Balanced braces. Or we could also remove else braces if allowed? But in C, else requires a statement, can be simple assignment without braces. The original had 'else b = 2;' which is okay. But the stray '}' at the end is the error. So just remove it.

But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error". Not many symbols.

We can just provide fixed code. We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Probably best to output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe need to add braces? But "else b = 2;" is syntactically correct in C-like. But they might want braces symmetrical. The original had a stray '}'. Remove it.

I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But to be safe, maybe include braces: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Which one? The error was syntax error, likely due to unmatched braces. The stray '}' at end. Removing it resolves syntax error. So I'll output code without the last '}'. The else statement can stay as is.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
