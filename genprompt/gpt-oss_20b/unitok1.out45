Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error using only the error message. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
The syntax is wrong: `《` and `》` are weird delimiters. Likely they intended braces. Also there is an extra `》` at the end. The else clause is already closed by parentheses? Actually code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》` The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the last `》`. Replace 《 with { and 》 with } for the first block. Also the else block should be `{b = 2;}`? In original code else b = 2; is okay. The last `》` should be removed. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. So output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
