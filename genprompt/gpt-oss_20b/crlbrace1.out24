Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: There's an unexpected '}' after else clause. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error is because the if statement is closed with `}` after else block. Also missing braces around else. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Remove extra `}` at end. Provide only fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
