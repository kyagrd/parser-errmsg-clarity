Thinking...
We have an error: syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The code uses if with parentheses, then [ ... ] else ... ; ]

The syntax might be similar to some languages using brackets? The code has an unmatched closing bracket at the end: ']' after the else block. Also else block lacks brackets. Probably we need to replace brackets with parentheses or braces? But instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only says "syntax error". So we can only use that. No pre-trained knowledge. But we can fix syntax error by making code syntactically correct.

We have 'if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]'. To fix: maybe remove the trailing ']' and add brackets around else block: else [ b = 2; ]. But then still mismatched brackets: there is opening '[' after condition, and closing ']' before else. The code currently: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ] -> There's an opening '[' after condition, closed after a=1; then else b=2; then closing ']' after else. So we can remove the last ']' and maybe wrap else block with brackets. Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But still we need closing brackets? Yes, now each block has its own brackets. That seems fine. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Check: there are two '[' and two ']' properly matched.

Thus output only the fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
