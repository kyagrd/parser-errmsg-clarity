Thinking...
The task: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only rely on the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we have code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems like there are wrong delimiters '《' '》' used instead of braces {}. The error says after else clause unexpected '》', meaning that the parser expects else clause but found '》'. So to fix, replace 《 and 》 with curly braces.

So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But need to check else branch: else b = 2; should be { b = 2; } or else b = 2; is fine because else requires a statement; but after if statement we need braces? In many languages else requires statement. else b = 2; is a statement. But might need braces if we want to wrap. But the error says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That indicates after 'else', the next token should be a statement but found '》'. So fix by removing '》' and adding proper braces. Also remove trailing '》' at the end of file.

Thus final code block: inside triple backquotes.

We should output only the fixed code inside triple backquote block.

Therefore final answer.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
