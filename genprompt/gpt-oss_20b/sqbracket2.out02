Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra ']' after else clause. We need to remove it. The syntax uses brackets for blocks, perhaps like: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. There's an extra ] at end. Also maybe need to wrap else part in brackets. But the error message says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So after else, there's b = 2; ] – the bracket after else is unexpected. So we can remove that bracket. But we might also need to open a bracket for else. Perhaps original intends:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But that has closing bracket after else. In the given, there's an extra bracket after else. So fix: remove last bracket. Also maybe need to add opening bracket before b=2? But the syntax in error message says only using symbols that appear in the error message. The error message says unexpected ']' after else clause. So we need to remove that ']' after else clause. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that may still be wrong due to missing bracket after else. But maybe syntax allows else without bracket? Hard. The error indicates that else clause is closed. So remove bracket after else. Provide fixed code. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 
```
