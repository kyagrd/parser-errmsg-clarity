Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We have an error message: "syntax error". They want to see only the fixed code in triple backquotes. The code uses unusual brackets: “《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Looks like they used wrong bracket characters. The corrected code should use normal braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. So we output that. Also, the syntax likely needs a semicolon after the if block? Actually, in Java/C/C++/C#/JavaScript, the syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. That is correct. So output inside triple backticks. No explanation. Just the fixed code. Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
