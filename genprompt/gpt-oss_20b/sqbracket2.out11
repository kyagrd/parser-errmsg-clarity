Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

It uses square brackets like [ and ]. Probably they intend to use square brackets to enclose statements but the else clause incorrectly closed. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause. There's a stray closing bracket at end. The if statement already closed.

We need to produce fixed code. Probably change to:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But that still may be same? Let's think. The original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The stray ] at end should be removed or matched. Maybe the else block should be bracketed. If the syntax uses brackets for blocks, then else should be: else [ b = 2; ]. So we should replace the stray final ']' with '[' before else. Let's construct:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

This eliminates the stray bracket. That should compile. The error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So after else there's a ']', which is unexpected. So we change that to '['. That is likely correct.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
