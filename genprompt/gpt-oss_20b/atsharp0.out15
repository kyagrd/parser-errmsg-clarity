Thinking...
We have code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. It's using C-like syntax. The syntax error likely due to '@' symbol, maybe using C? Or the `#` comments after semicolon cause syntax error in C++? In C/C++ `#` is preprocessor directive. But inside code it's not allowed. Also using semicolon after if: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` is invalid because `@` not allowed. Also after `;` else part is not proper.

Goal: Use only the error message. So we have syntax error. We need to produce corrected code. Possibly minimal changes: remove `@` and comments. And use correct syntax for if-else.

So corrected code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That's all.

But there might be requirement: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot reference pre-trained knowledge, only use the error message. But we still need to fix. We can produce corrected code. They didn't specify language, but given C-like syntax, it's C/C++ or Java.

Thus output only the fixed code inside triple backquote block:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Make sure to include semicolons properly. So final.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
