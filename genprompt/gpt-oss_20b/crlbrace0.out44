Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code has a mismatched closing brace at end. Also else statement missing braces but can be allowed. Let's see:

Original: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Error syntax. The final '}' is extra. Also else part missing braces but that's allowed. The corrected code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But better to add braces: else { b = 2; }

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's fixed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
