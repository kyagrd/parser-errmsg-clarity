Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to use only symbols that appear in error message, "syntax error". That includes characters: s y n t a x e r r o r? Actually error message just says "syntax error". We can use symbols that appear in that phrase: letters s y n t a x e r o. But we can use parentheses, brackets etc? We have to fix error. The code seems to want an if statement: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. But the code uses brackets [ ] incorrectly. The final ']' is extraneous. We need to correct. The error message "syntax error" does not give hints, but we can only use symbols that appear in the error message? That seems odd: we can only use letters from "syntax error". But maybe we can use any symbol? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can use parentheses, brackets, braces? They appear not in error message. So we may not use them? But the phrase contains parentheses? Actually error message "syntax error" doesn't contain parentheses. But we can still use brackets? We should avoid using new symbols not in error message? The code uses parentheses and brackets, maybe they are allowed. I'd just correct it to a typical syntax. The final code block: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But that still has mismatched brackets? The else block uses brackets? We need to match pairs. Maybe we need to remove the extraneous ']' at end and ensure each block has matching '[' and ']'. So:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Now the brackets open and close. That might be the fix. Or use braces {} but that's not in error message. But we could use braces, but not allowed? The instruction ambiguous. I'd output the fixed code.
...done thinking.
