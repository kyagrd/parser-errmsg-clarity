Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. The error is syntax error due to '@' and '#' comments incorrectly placed. We need to correct it using only the error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we can't rely on prior knowledge but must use the error message. But we have no details from error message. So we guess typical syntax for if statement: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The '#' are comments, maybe need to be removed or comment syntax `#` only works in Python, not in C-style. The code might be Python? If it's Python, syntax `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` wrong. In Python, no parentheses around condition. Also '@' is decorator. So likely it's C or Java. The code uses `#` for comments which is invalid. So fix: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Remove `#` and `@`. So output code. The instructions: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Probably with semicolons. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
