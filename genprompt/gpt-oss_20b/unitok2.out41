Thinking...
We have error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses 《 and 》 like some custom syntax. They probably mean delimiters. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The else clause should be within 《 》 maybe. The syntax error: '》' after else clause - after else, there's 'b = 2; 》', but the else clause is closed? Actually if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The error indicates after else clause, there's an unexpected 》. Means we should close the else clause with 》, but the if statement is already closed? Let's parse: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The outermost closing 》 after else might be incorrectly placed. Perhaps we should remove the final 》. Maybe else block should be also enclosed: else 《 b = 2; 》. So code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That might fix. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
