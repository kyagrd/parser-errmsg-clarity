Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses wrong bracket characters 《 and 》. They need to be replaced with curly braces {} or semicolons. The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So basically the code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to output only fixed code. Use standard C-like syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; // maybe braces for else too but not required. The code likely expects braces for then part, else part could be single statement.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wrap in triple backticks. Done.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
