Thinking...
We need to output fixed code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have syntax error. We must fix using only the error message "syntax error" and the symbols that appear in the error message. But the error message is just "syntax error" without any symbols. Hmm "symbols that appear in the error message" would be just the words "syntax" and "error" maybe. But we likely can just fix the code by proper braces. The code likely wants:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

And remove the stray closing brace at end.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe need to keep the outer braces? There's an extra `}` at end. So remove it. So final code block:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. No extra text.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
