Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code has an extra '}'. The correct syntax should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the code originally had no braces around else block, but added an extra '}'. So fix by adding braces to else or remove the extra '}'. According to error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests we have an extra '}'. Remove that. The else has no braces, but we can either keep it as else b = 2; and remove the last '}'. That would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

However, typical style uses braces for both. But the error message indicates that after else clause there's an unexpected '}'. So fix by removing the '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`

But we might also need to consider syntax: else b = 2; is fine, though semicolon after b = 2; maybe need to close with braces. But simplest fix: remove last '}'. So final code inside triple backticks: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Thus output.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
