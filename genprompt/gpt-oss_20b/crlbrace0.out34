Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only error message. But basically we need to produce fixed code: probably we need to close the braces properly. The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra closing brace at end. Also missing braces around else? Not necessary but maybe to match structure. The correct code likely:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or if we want minimal change: remove the last brace. Also else should have braces? But else without braces is allowed: else b = 2;. The syntax error is due to unmatched braces: an extra } at end. So remove that. So code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But still the else statement might need braces? Actually else b = 2; is fine. But we must keep consistent style. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe the error was because of the missing brace after else? Actually the code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } The else statement not in braces; that's fine. But then there's an extra } at end. So just remove that. Provide fixed code. Let's output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
