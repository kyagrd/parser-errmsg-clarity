Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to fix syntax using symbols available. The error message is just "syntax error". But we should not use pre-trained knowledge, only error message. But we can still guess that likely need to replace square brackets with parentheses or curly braces. The snippet uses if (x > 0) [ ... ] else b = 2; ]. There's an unmatched bracket at end. Also else block missing brackets. We could change to if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. Use braces. Also close brackets accordingly. Provide code block.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
