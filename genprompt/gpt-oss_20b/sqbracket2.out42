Thinking...
The prompt: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must only use the error message as guidance. Error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That indicates that the ']' after else clause is unexpected, because the if statement is already closed. In code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So they want to remove that stray `]`. Also, maybe need to correct bracket usage. If the syntax uses brackets for block? In error message, maybe they want to close if properly. The code likely intended: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. The stray `]` after else clause is unexpected because if statement is closed. So we can either remove that bracket or wrap else block. They ask: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That suggests use brackets `[` and `]`. So we can fix by removing trailing `]`. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. But we might need to close else block? Not necessary. They say "syntax may be different from existing languages". So we only fix error.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe need to close the else block? Since else clause may not require block. The stray `]` at the end is the error. So just remove it.

Therefore final answer is above.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
