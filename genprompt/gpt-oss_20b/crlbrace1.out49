Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There's an extra closing brace '}'. Also else clause missing braces: else b = 2; but need braces for else block? In JavaScript? But code seems C-like. The else needs block if we have braces. But else can be single statement without braces. The error is unexpected '}' after else clause. That means the extra '}'. We just remove it. Also maybe add braces to match if? Let's check: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } -> after else clause, we have "b = 2; }". The closing brace is after else clause, but we had opened only one brace after if. We close that before else: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There is a matching pair: first '{' after if opens block; then '}' closes block before else. So the else is at top level. But we still have a stray '}' after else, causing error. Remove that. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`

Alternatively, could add braces around else statement but that is optional. But better keep minimal fix: remove trailing '}'. So answer: code block with corrected code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
