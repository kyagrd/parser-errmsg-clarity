Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Syntax error: The closing brace at end doesn't match. Also else missing braces maybe. The else clause: `else b = 2;` is valid in some languages (C). But we have an extra '}' at end. So we need to remove the extra '}'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively we might need braces around else: `else { b = 2; }`. But original has no brace. It's still valid. But error due to unmatched '}'. So just remove last '}'. Provide fixed code.

But also ensure there's a trailing semicolon? Already fine. So final output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
