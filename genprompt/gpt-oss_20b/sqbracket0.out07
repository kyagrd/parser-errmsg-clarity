Thinking...
We need to correct syntax errors only using error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So only the error message is "syntax error". So we can't use other info. But we need to produce fixed code.

The original code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We can guess it's a C-like language. We need to use braces instead of brackets. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also the stray ']' at the end should be removed. That is the fixed code.

Thus output inside triple backticks.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
