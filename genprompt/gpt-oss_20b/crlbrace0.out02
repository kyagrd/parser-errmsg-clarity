Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to use ONLY the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. So we must deduce the error from syntax. The code appears to have an extra closing brace at the end. It also missing braces around else body? In many languages, else can be single statement without braces. But there is an extra closing brace. Also missing opening brace for the if? Actually if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } -> The if has opening and closing braces. The else part is b=2; no braces. Then there's an extra } after else block.

Thus the fix: Remove the extra closing brace. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But if we need braces for else? Not necessary. The error might also be that else statement must have braces? No, it's allowed. The code is likely in C or JavaScript. Extra brace is syntax error.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We should output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
