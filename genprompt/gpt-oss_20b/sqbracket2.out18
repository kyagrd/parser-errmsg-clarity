Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to remove or correct the extra ']' after else clause. Possibly remove last ']' or replace with proper syntax.

We are told to use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we can still produce plausible correction: maybe close with ']' before else? Actually structure: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. This has two ']' after else. Remove last one.

Also maybe else syntax should have brackets: else [ b = 2; ]. So fix: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But the error says after else clause (if statement already closed). It indicates there's an extra bracket after else. So we remove last bracket. That gives: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That might compile? If language expects else to be followed by block. But we keep as is.

Given the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains ']', 'else', 'if', 'statement', 'closed'. So we can use brackets. I'd output: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. That's probably good.

Thus final answer: triple backquotes code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
