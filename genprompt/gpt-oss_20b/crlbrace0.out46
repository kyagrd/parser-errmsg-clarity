Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in the code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message is just "syntax error". That suggests there's a syntax error in the code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace. Also missing braces around else statement. The correct code could be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But we are told "using ONLY the error message" meaning we cannot rely on pre-trained knowledge; but we can infer from the syntax error. We need to produce fixed code.

Thus output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.

So final output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or we could do separate block. I'll output minimal: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Ensure balanced braces.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
