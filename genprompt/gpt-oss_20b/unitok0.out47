Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message: "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge? It says "without using the pre-trained knowledge". They want to fix the syntax error using only the error message? That seems odd. But likely they want us to guess the fix. The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The error syntax due to wrong brackets. It should be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Use braces. So output fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
