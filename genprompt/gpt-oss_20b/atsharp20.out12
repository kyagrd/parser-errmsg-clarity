Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquote block. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message is just "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error" with no symbols. The code appears to be maybe some pseudo-language. We need to fix syntax error. There's an '@' after condition: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". Maybe '@' is not correct; maybe we want 'then' or nothing. Also the comment markers '#' appear around else part. In many languages comments start with '//' or '/*', but here '#' maybe comment. So code may be something like:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Thus fix: remove '@' and '#' comment marks, and add else. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we must use symbols that appear in error message, but error message "syntax error" doesn't give any symbol. So just produce fixed code. Output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
