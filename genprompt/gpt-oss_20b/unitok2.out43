Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY error message. The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests that the '》' is being used as block delimiters? In this syntax, maybe the code uses `《` and `》` as braces like `<` and `>`? The error says after else clause, the `》` appears but if statement already closed. Means that the else part is considered closed already. So we need to adjust such that else part uses `《` and `》` properly. The code currently: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. This has two `》` after the `if`: one after `a = 1;`, one after the entire statement. The else part is `b = 2; 》` but no opening `《` before `b = 2;`. Should be `else 《 b = 2; 》`. Also the closing `》` after else should match. Let's fix: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Also need to close the if? There's no closing for the if. The outer `》` might close the if block? But if we have `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. That uses a single `》` after each block. This likely works. So output code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
But we need to ensure correct placement of closing brackets. According to syntax, maybe need `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. That is probably correct. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
