Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So after the else clause, there is a '#', but the else clause isn't there. The error likely due to stray '#'.

We need to produce fixed code.

The code may be a custom language; syntax might be if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;

But the '#' may be comment or special.

In the error message, '#' after else clause indicates maybe '#' is comment marker but else clause not present. So we remove '#'.

Thus fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`.

But original had `# else b = 2; #`. So we need to remove both '#' and the else? Wait: They want to use only error message symbols? The error message says 'unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)'. The else clause is not closed? Actually the if statement already closed before else clause, meaning else is after the if block ended. So to fix, we need to place else inside the block or remove the else. Probably simpler: remove the else clause and the '#'.

But they want to use only the error message? Let's interpret: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only contains words and punctuation: 'unexpected', '#', 'after', 'else', 'clause', '(if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed)'.

Symbols: '#', '(', ')', maybe.

So we can use '#'.

But the '#' is problematic. We could comment out the else clause with '# else b = 2; #' meaning maybe '#' used for comments. But then why else? The else is inside comment? The syntax error says unexpected '#' after else clause. So after the else clause there's a '#', but the if statement closed earlier, so else not expected. So we can comment out the else clause: `# else b = 2; #` but it's still after else. Maybe we need to remove else entirely.

Thus fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` maybe comment out else and b? But the else is inside comment, but the parser still sees else? Actually if '#' starts comment, everything until next '#' is comment. So `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` The parser sees `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` then comment ` else b = 2; ` and end comment. So it's fine. But original had else outside comment? Wait original: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` In this, the comment begins at first '#', ends at next '#'. So else inside comment. So parser doesn't see else. So error message wouldn't happen. But original code shows else outside comment? Let's check original: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. This has two '#', so yes, else inside comment. But error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe '#' is not comment marker, but something else. So to fix, we need to remove the trailing '#', or maybe replace it with something else.

Thus the minimal fix: Remove the trailing '#'. So code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`. But then still has '#' after else. The parser expects else clause inside if. The else is preceded by '#', so maybe '#' indicates something else. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, meaning the parser saw else clause, then '#', unexpected. So we remove '#'. So code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems simplest. No '#' anywhere.

Thus final answer: inside triple backticks, the fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
