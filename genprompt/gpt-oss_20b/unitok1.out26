Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code uses Chinese brackets 《 》 incorrectly. We need to use proper parentheses/braces? The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. We need to replace with correct syntax. Use curly braces or semicolons. The simplest: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; The extra bracket should be removed. The last bracket '》' after else? Actually else b = 2; 》. So remove that. Also no need for '》' after if statement. So final code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

We output only the fixed code inside triple backquote.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
