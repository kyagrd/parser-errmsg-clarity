Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They use some special characters: 《 and 》. In C-like syntax, if statement uses braces {}. So the error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). We need to replace those symbols with proper braces.

Thus correct code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it.

We output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. No explanation.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
