Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)".

So the syntax might be some custom language: if condition then something. But we see "@" and "#". The '#' likely is a comment indicator or something. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

We have "@" after the condition before the first statement: maybe "@" is some operator? But the error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). That suggests that after "else" there's a "#", which might indicate a comment or something. But we have "# else b = 2; #" inside code. So the code likely should be something like:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;

But the '#' are causing error. We need to remove or adjust the '#' such that it's not after else. Maybe comments? The code should not contain '#' outside comment context. The error indicates that the else clause has a '#' after it, which is unexpected. So remove the '#' after else clause. Also maybe remove '#' before else. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`.

But the "@" symbol might still be odd. But we are to fix syntax error only. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wrap inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
