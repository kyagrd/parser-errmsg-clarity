Thinking...
We have to produce fixed code. There's syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to correct. The code seems like C-like. Should be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Remove stray '}'. So fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
