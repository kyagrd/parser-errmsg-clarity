Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error using only the error message. The error says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the code uses special brackets 《 and 》. The error says after else clause, an unexpected 》. The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The error is likely due to a stray 》 after else. So remove the trailing 》 after else. The else block should be enclosed maybe in 《 ... 》 as well? But error says after else clause (if statement already closed). That means the if block is closed, then else is okay but then a 》 appears. So we need to close else block with 》 maybe? The code uses `《` to open and `》` to close. So maybe correct is:

`if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. So replace the trailing 》 after else with opening and closing appropriately.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
