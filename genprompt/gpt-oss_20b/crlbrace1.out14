Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There's an extra closing brace after the else clause. The correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or we can use no braces: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the fix: remove the extra `}` or add a brace pair. Probably remove the last `}`. But we must output fixed code. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's one solution. Alternatively:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

The requirement: use ONLY the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error message suggests that after else, the statement already closed. So the correct is to remove the final `}`. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe best to put braces around else. But either is correct. I'll output the simplest: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
