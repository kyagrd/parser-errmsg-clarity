Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error message: syntax error. It suggests we need to correct the syntax, but we must use only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. So we can only use symbols that appear in the error message. But the error message is "syntax error". That includes the words "syntax" and "error". No symbols there. But maybe they mean we can only use the symbols that appear in the error message? Actually the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only contains "syntax error". That doesn't have symbols. So we can't use any special symbols? But we can still modify code.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code originally uses some unusual symbols: 《 and 》 for delimiters. We might need to replace them with something else that matches typical syntax.

It says "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So it's not necessarily following any specific language, but we can assume it's a conditional statement with block delimiters using these unusual brackets. Perhaps the error arises because the "else" part is not enclosed in the correct delimiters, or the closing delimiter is misplaced. Let's examine:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

It seems like the if clause encloses "a = 1;" inside 《 ... 》, then else part "b = 2;" outside. But there's an extra 》 at the end. Possibly the correct syntax is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 ?

But the code originally ends with an extra 》. So maybe the correct code should be:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》

But I'm not sure.

We can also consider that the "else" must also be inside 《 ... 》. Or maybe the code should be:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》

Thus remove the trailing 》 after else part. Wait original: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The extra 》 is after the semicolon of else part. So to fix syntax, we can remove the trailing 》. Then we have: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;`. That might be correct.

But maybe the else part should be inside delimiters as well. The error could be due to mismatch of delimiters. But we don't know.

We need to produce fixed code. I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to also enclose else part:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Which one is more likely? The error is syntax error. The code uses `else b = 2; 》`. The presence of `>` after `else` is not correct. Wait we have a stray `>` after the closing 》? The code ends with `; 》`. That's not typical. So perhaps the syntax error is due to the stray `>` after `else`. Actually the stray 》 is closing bracket. But the error might be that the closing bracket should not be after the semicolon. It should be after the block. But we already had one after the block for if. So the trailing one is extraneous. So removing it is likely.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;`

But the question: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They want to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message "syntax error" doesn't have symbols. So we can't change anything except maybe remove the extraneous 》.

Thus answer:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
