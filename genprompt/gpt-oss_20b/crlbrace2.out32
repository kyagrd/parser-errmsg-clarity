Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error using only error message. Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } So there's an extra closing brace. Remove it. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That's all. Provide in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
