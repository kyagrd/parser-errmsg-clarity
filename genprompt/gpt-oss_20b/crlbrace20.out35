Thinking...
We need to output the fixed code. They mention using ONLY the error message. Error message is "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at the end. Also missing braces around else block. Perhaps:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The error message "syntax error" doesn't give specifics. They ask: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The only symbol is maybe the word 'syntax error' but we can't use that. Just fix. Let's output the corrected code in triple backticks.

We need only the code, inside triple backticks.

Thus final answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
