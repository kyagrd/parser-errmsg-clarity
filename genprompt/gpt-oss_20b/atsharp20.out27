Thinking...
We have an error: syntax error. We must fix using only error message. The message is just "syntax error". That gives no details. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message: "syntax error" contains letters and space. No punctuation. We must use only symbols that appear? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use letters s y n t a x e r r o r and space. So no parentheses, no if, no else, etc. But maybe we can use the code with only these characters? But code uses if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. We can try to rewrite to something that uses only those letters? We need to keep code structure but maybe modify to avoid syntax error. But we can't use parentheses or brackets. But maybe we can remove parentheses and use just if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2. But '>' not allowed. But we can use only symbols that appear in error message: letters and space. So cannot use >, =, ;, #, @. Hmm.

We can perhaps use only the words syntax error? The code could be replaced with just "syntax error". But output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. But maybe the intention is to keep the code but change syntax. We can replace "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" with "if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2". But still uses >, =, etc.

Alternatively maybe we can use comment syntax? The error message contains no punctuation. The instruction might be to use only symbols that appear in error message, if available. So we can use the words syntax and error. So we could write "syntax error". But that would be weird.

Better approach: We can fix the syntax by replacing problematic tokens with valid ones. The code has @, #. We can remove them. So code becomes: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But still uses parentheses, >, etc. But the instruction says we can use any symbols; only need to fix syntax error. The error message doesn't give details, but we can guess: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" likely syntax error due to '@' and '#'. So we can remove '@' and '#', and remove semicolons maybe. So fixed code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; This might be acceptable.

But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe we should not introduce any new symbols not in error message? But we can still use them if they appear in error message: "syntax error" has letters s y n t a x e r. We cannot use parentheses or >, =, etc. But that seems too restrictive. Maybe the intention is to use the word "syntax error" to indicate that the code has syntax error. Actually maybe the correct answer is just to output "syntax error" as the fixed code? But that seems odd.

Maybe the error message is generic, so we should just rewrite the code to something syntactically correct using only allowed symbols? The instruction "symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Means if we need a symbol, try to use one that appears in error message. But the error message "syntax error" has no special symbols like parentheses, equals, semicolons. So we cannot use any of those, but we can use letters. So we could write "syntax error" but that would not be code. But maybe the "code" syntax can be letters and spaces.

Let's think: maybe the language is not defined. We can just replace problematic tokens with something else that uses only letters: e.g., "ifxgreater0 a1 else b2" but still uses > and =. Can't.

Maybe we can use "if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2" but still uses > and =.

Perhaps the instruction is misleading; we can just fix by removing @ and #. So output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
