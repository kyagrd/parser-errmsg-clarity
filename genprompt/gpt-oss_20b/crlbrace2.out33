Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra '}' after else clause. Also else b = 2; needs braces. To keep style minimal, we can add braces around else block: else { b = 2; }. Also remove the stray '}'. The code inside backticks.

So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check: no unmatched braces. Output only code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
