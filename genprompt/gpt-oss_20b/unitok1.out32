Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. They want to fix syntax error in code using ONLY error message, no pre-trained knowledge. But we can produce correct code. The original code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They used 《 and 》 as braces? Actually error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means they used wrong delimiters. Should be curly braces { }.

So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Probably.

Also they might want to show only code block. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
