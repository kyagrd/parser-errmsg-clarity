Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra '}' after else clause. We need to remove it. So corrected: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. So output that.
...done thinking.

```
// Fixed code
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
