Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we need to produce fixed code.

Given code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at end. Also missing braces around else block? In many languages, else without braces is okay, but extra } is wrong. So remove the extra }.

Also missing semicolon after else block? else b = 2; is fine.

So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively could wrap else block in braces: { b = 2; } but unnecessary.

Thus output that code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
