Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. We should remove the extra '}' at the end, maybe also add braces after else? The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has `else b = 2; }`. The `}` after else is wrong. So we should remove the extra '}'. The else part should not be followed by a '}'. But we could also decide to wrap else block in braces: else { b = 2; } That would be correct. The original else clause: else b = 2; } - there's an unmatched }. So we need to remove that or replace. The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The easiest fix: remove the '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That's the corrected code. Output in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
