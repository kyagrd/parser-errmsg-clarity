Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an unmatched `}` at the end, and the else clause is missing braces: else b=2; Should be else { b = 2; } . Also maybe remove the trailing `}`. So correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That resolves syntax. Output inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
