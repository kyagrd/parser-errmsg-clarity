Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error in the code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They want to output the fixed code inside triple backticks. They want to use symbols that appear in the error message if available. The error message mentions '》'. The code uses 《 and 》. It seems like some custom syntax where maybe 《 is opening bracket and 》 is closing. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That suggests that after else b = 2; there's an extra 》. The original code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. It seems that the else clause is: else b = 2; 》. The final 》 after else might be extraneous.

To fix: Remove the final 》, keep opening 《 and closing 》 around each statement? The if clause: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; (maybe else also should have brackets). Possibly we need to add a closing 》 after else block? Actually the error indicates after else clause, the statement already closed. So maybe else b = 2; 》 is wrong. Instead else 《 b = 2; 》. So the else block should be wrapped. So the fixed code likely:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But maybe we should not add a trailing 》 after else. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

That uses symbols from error message. I think that is correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
