Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
The error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the syntax error is because the # comment after else is misplaced. Also there's an "@" symbol after the condition, not typical. Likely the code intended to use a ternary operator or something? But we must fix syntax using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. We need to produce a corrected version. The error message indicates after else clause there's unexpected '#', meaning the else clause was already closed? Actually the code uses a single if, no else block. But the comment '# else b = 2;' seems to be interpreted as code. The @ symbol is weird. We could just remove the '#' comments and the '@' maybe? But we have to fix syntax.

We could write:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But then we have no 'end' or braces, but in many languages you can do if-else with single statements.

Alternatively, we might need braces:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But the original had an "@" maybe to indicate a directive. But the simplest fix is to remove '#' comments and the '@', and add else. But error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So if we remove the '#' and use else properly. The code originally didn't have an else clause. So we need to add else? The error says after else clause but code didn't have else. But maybe the parser thought that the '#' was marking else? Hard.

I think the intended correct code is:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We don't need '@'. So final code block: triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
