Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We see that the if statement syntax seems wrong. In many languages like C or JavaScript, it's if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; So we need to remove @ symbol, maybe comment syntax wrong. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. So '#' used as comment in Python but this is not Python. It appears like we used '#' to comment after else but incorrectly placed. The code likely should be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need to fix by using the error message only. The error message indicates that the '#' after else clause is unexpected because the if statement is already closed. So we remove the '#' characters after the else and the trailing '#'. Also the '@' is wrong; maybe it's a typo for '->' or '?:'. Probably just remove '@'.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe also need braces? But original syntax uses single line if statement. So final code: as above. Ensure no other syntax errors. Provide only fixed code.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
