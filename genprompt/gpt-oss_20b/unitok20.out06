Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, which just says "syntax error". The code uses weird symbols: 《 and 》. The error says syntax error. We need to fix syntax using symbols that appear in error message if available. But error message is just "syntax error". No symbols. So we can't use symbols from error message. Maybe we just need to correct the syntax by using correct brackets or something. The original code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses 《 as start, 》 as end. Perhaps the correct syntax is to use braces {}.

Thus we produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instructions: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." There's no symbol in error message. So we just produce the corrected code with usual brackets. But maybe they want us to use the same 《 and 》? But that would be error. So I think correct is braces. Provide the fixed code inside triple backticks.

We should output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus final answer: ```if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
