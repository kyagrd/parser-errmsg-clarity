Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax: use curly braces or parentheses. The error is extra ']' at the end. Also, the else block not properly enclosed. The correct code likely:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively if single statements can use semicolons: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; That's simplest.

Thus output fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`

But need no trailing ]. So output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That seems correct.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
