Thinking...
We have an error message: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax error. The code appears to be some C-like syntax. The problem: extra closing brace at the end. Also missing braces around else block? Let's parse: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an unmatched '}'. The else should have a block or no braces but then we need to close the initial if. Let's rewrite: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } That adds missing braces. Or we can remove the trailing '}'. But it's likely that the else needs braces. The syntax error due to extra '}'. So fix by removing that or adding matching braces. I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This seems correct. Provide code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
