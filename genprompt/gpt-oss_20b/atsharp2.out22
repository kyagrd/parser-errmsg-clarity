Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)

It seems code uses some custom syntax: 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1;' then '# else b = 2; #'? The '#' seems comment? The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, if statement already closed. So likely the 'else' should not have '#', or the '#' is being treated as a delimiter incorrectly.

We need to fix syntax error using only symbols from error message. Error message mentions '#'. So maybe we should remove the '#' after else or close else with something else. The code uses '@' maybe it's a separator? We need to produce fixed code that does not produce error. Since the code is not standard, but we can guess the correct form is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Remove the '#' characters. That should fix.

Thus output the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
