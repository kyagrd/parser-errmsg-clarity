Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We have an error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). We need to correct syntax using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error message indicates that '#' after else clause is unexpected; if statement is already closed. The code uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. It seems the code is in some language like maybe Python or JavaScript? It uses `@` symbol maybe Ruby? In Ruby, an if statement: `if x > 0; a = 1; else; b = 2; end`. But the code has `@` before a variable maybe instance variable: `@a = 1`. And there is a comment marker '#', which is typical of Ruby. So the code is Ruby: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` But Ruby syntax: `if x > 0; @a = 1; else; b = 2; end`. So the code is wrong. The error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code probably has stray '#' after else. The fix: Remove the stray '#' and use correct Ruby syntax. So the fixed code: 
```
if x > 0
  @a = 1
else
  b = 2
end
```
But we need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The requirement: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." This seems contradictory: We cannot use pre-trained knowledge? But we can rely on the error message. The error message says unexpected '#' after else clause. So remove the '#' after else. So code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` becomes `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But also Ruby requires semicolons? We can keep semicolons. So final code: `if (x > 0) @a = 1; else b = 2; end`. Wait the original code had no `end`. The error message mentions if statement already closed, maybe missing `end`. The code uses `@ a = 1;` which is wrong. Should be `@a = 1`. And the '#' after else is stray. So final code: `if (x > 0) @a = 1; else b = 2; end`. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```ruby
if (x > 0) @a = 1; else b = 2; end
```
