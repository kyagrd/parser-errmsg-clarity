Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They provide error message "syntax error". They provide code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

We need to fix the syntax error. The code has an unmatched closing brace: there is an extra } at the end. Also, the else clause is missing braces. The correct code could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

or we can keep the else without braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But we need to remove the extra }. So we can correct by removing the last }.

Given the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems odd: use only the error message? But the error message is generic. But we can infer that it's syntax error due to mismatched braces. The only fix: remove the extra closing brace. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But might still be a syntax error because else must be followed by a statement, which is b = 2; That is fine. But typical style is braces, but not required. So the corrected code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, to be safe, add braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Better style. Let's choose that. So final answer: only code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
