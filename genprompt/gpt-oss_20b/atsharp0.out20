Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
This is invalid. Likely they want correct syntax: use `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The `@` and `#` characters are erroneous. We only need to output fixed code inside triple backticks. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That's the answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
