Thinking...
We need to produce the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code originally:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The issue: The code has 'else' comment? Actually the code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The '#' comments appear after else? Actually there's no else, just comment. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Possibly the syntax expects a single-line comment after the else clause? But there is no else. Maybe the error is due to stray '#', or missing else. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So use symbols from error message. The error message mentions unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the issue is stray '#'. We can remove the '#' or comment properly. Let's produce code that removes the '#'. The code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the error said else clause already closed, so maybe we need to remove the '#' after else. But there's no else clause. The code maybe should be:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, use comment syntax '//' or '/* */'. But we can just remove '#' characters. Provide fixed code.

Thus final answer: triple backticks with code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe the '@' is part of syntax? Could be an assignment operator? Keep it.

Thus output only fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
