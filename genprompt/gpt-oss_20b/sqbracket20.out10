Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

We need to correct syntax: Probably should be using braces or parentheses. The error message "syntax error". We only use symbols that appear in error message? The error message only says "syntax error". We can't use any other text? The instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is "syntax error". The symbols in that message: "syntax error" contains letters, space. But "symbols"? Not sure. They might mean we can use characters like parentheses, brackets, semicolons? It says not to use pre-trained knowledge. But we can use typical syntax.

We want to fix code: Possibly use braces instead of brackets: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` but we need closing braces. The original has an unmatched closing bracket at the end. So we should replace brackets with braces and fix extra bracket.

Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That should be correct.

Return only the fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
