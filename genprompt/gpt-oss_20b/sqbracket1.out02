Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: code shows:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to use only error message to fix: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we remove stray brackets and semicolons.

Proper syntax in C-like: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But maybe we want minimal changes: replace '[' with '{', ']' with '}'. Also the trailing ']' at end should be removed.

So corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Provide inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
