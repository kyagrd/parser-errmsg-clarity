Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`". The instruction: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So we need to produce only the corrected code. The syntax error likely due to '@' being wrong. Also the comment marks '#' are not C-like but maybe it's some language. The code likely in C: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So the fix: remove '@', remove '#'. So produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe the language uses '# else' as a comment? Actually '# else' is a preprocessor directive in C? But not. The simplest: remove '@', remove '# else', replace with else. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. We'll output that inside triple backticks.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
