Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This seems like a C-like syntax but uses '@' incorrectly and '# else' comment. We need to produce correct code. The instructions: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That suggests we should rely only on the error message "syntax error". But we can guess. They want a corrected code.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote. So produce something like:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Better. The original had '# else b = 2; #', so we replace with proper else block.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
