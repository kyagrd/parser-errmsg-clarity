The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

Error message: "syntax error"

Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

They want only the fixed code in triple backquotes. Also note that the syntax may be different from existing languages, like C, Java, Python, etc. We need to fix the syntax error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only has "syntax error". The symbols present: maybe 'syntax', 'error', but maybe we can use the word 'syntax' or 'error' or the exclamation marks or something. But we are not told to use any specific symbols. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message has only the words "syntax error". So the symbols we have: letters 's','y','n','t','a','x','e','r','r','o','r', space, and maybe nothing else. So we could incorporate 'syntax' or 'error'. But we just need to fix the syntax error in the code. We can't use pre-trained knowledge, but we can assume typical syntax.

We need to replace '@' maybe with '=' or something, and remove stray '#' comments. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

If this is a C-like syntax: we could write: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; 

But the instruction says do not use pre-trained knowledge? But maybe we can interpret that we should use only error message symbols? But it's ambiguous.

The phrase: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Might mean we should only use the error message text to determine the fix. The error message is "syntax error". That suggests a syntax error. But we cannot use prior knowledge of the code's language? The code might not be a standard language. We can fix it by removing the '@', '#' and adjusting the syntax. But we need to use symbols that appear in the error message. That might be 'syntax' or 'error'.

Maybe we can use 'syntax' as a variable name? Or 'error'?

We could write:

if (x > 0) syntax = 1; # else error = 2; #

But we need valid syntax? Might be weird.

Alternatively, we could just output: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; This uses only standard symbols. But the instructions ask to use symbols that appear in the error message. That could mean we should include the words 'syntax' or 'error'. But it's not mandatory; they said "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we could still use normal symbols. So the simplest fix: replace '@' with nothing? Actually '@' seems erroneous; we want to assign a to 1; so it's: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; Also remove trailing '#', which maybe comment syntax but not correct here. So final code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; 

But we need to output inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's provide that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
