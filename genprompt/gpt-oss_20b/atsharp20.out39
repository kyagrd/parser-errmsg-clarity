Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We must use ONLY the error message, which is "syntax error". But instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" contains letters s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o, r. But we have to fix the code. We need to correct syntax. The code seems like a pseudo-language. The error likely due to "@" and "#". Maybe we should remove them. The syntax could be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We can output that. They said "Use ONLY the error message" meaning maybe use symbols in "syntax error"? But likely just correct.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

No extra commentary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
