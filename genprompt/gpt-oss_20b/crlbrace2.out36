Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra '}'. Remove last brace. Also else clause missing braces: else b = 2; is fine? In some languages else requires braces but not all. But given error message about '}', we remove last }.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
