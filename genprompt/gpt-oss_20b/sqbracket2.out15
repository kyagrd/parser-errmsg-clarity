Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. It seems uses brackets like [ ]. They had closing ] after else. The syntax: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ] -> there's an extra ] at the end. Remove last ]. Also maybe else clause needs brackets? It currently has else b = 2; no brackets. Maybe okay. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. Output only code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 
```
