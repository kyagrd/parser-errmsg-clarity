Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Symbols: 《 and 》 appear. Likely used as delimiters. We need to correct syntax to use correct brackets? Maybe should use parentheses or braces. The error message is generic "syntax error". We need to produce fixed code.

We could replace 《 and 》 with braces {} or parentheses? Use { }.

If we rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That would be typical.

But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Error message only says "syntax error" no symbols. So we can choose.

The note: syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages. So they may want to use 《 and 》 as delimiters. But currently they are mismatched: Opening で? They used 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》: There's an extra 》 after else. Should be if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. So missing opening for else block.

Thus fix: add 《 before else block: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Also ensure closing 》 after else block.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Also maybe we need to close the last `》`. They had one after else block.

Thus produce that.

But the problem: The code had closing `》` after else block? Provided: `else b = 2; 》`. That is an opening? Actually `》` is a closing bracket. So after else, they had no opening. So we add opening.

Thus final code inside triple backticks.

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
