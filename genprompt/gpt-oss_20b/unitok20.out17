Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They mention that syntax may differ from existing languages, and we should use symbols that appear in the error message if available. The error message: "syntax error" - no symbols. So maybe they want to replace 《 and 》 with braces? Maybe the code uses Chinese brackets to enclose statements. In standard languages, we use curly braces {}. So the correct code might be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But they mention "symbols that appear in the error message" - error message only contains "syntax error". No symbols. So not relevant.

Thus answer: the fixed code. Use backticks.

Let's produce final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
