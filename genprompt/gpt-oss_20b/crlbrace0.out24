Thinking...
We have a user asking: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block."

We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Observations: The if statement has a block for true, but else part is missing braces. Also there's an extra closing brace at the end. The correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But we must only output the fixed code inside triple backquotes. That means we output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But check if we need to maintain semicolons? Yes, a = 1; b = 2; good.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
