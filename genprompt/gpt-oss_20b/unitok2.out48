Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses special brackets 《 and 》. Likely they should be parentheses or braces. Probably the code should be: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } But they want to use the symbols from error message: '》' after else clause indicates the else clause had '》' after. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. We need to close the if statement properly. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe we should move the last 》 inside else block. So: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That would be correct: else block wrapped with 《》. So we keep the first 《 a = 1; 》. So final code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That uses same symbols. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
