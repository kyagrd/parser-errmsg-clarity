Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There's an extra closing brace '}' at the end. Also else clause syntax: need braces if multiple statements, but here single statement `b = 2;`. But else requires a statement after else; `b = 2;` is fine. The error likely due to unmatched brace. So remove the last '}'. Also the opening brace after if. So final: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. Ensure ends. So output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
