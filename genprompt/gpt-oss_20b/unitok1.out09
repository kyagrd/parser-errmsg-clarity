Thinking...
The user requests: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed) Code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》 Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block."

So we need to output only the fixed code within triple backticks. The error message says there's unexpected '》' after else clause, meaning they used wrong delimiters. The code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters, but in C-like syntax we need {} or no braces. So we should replace them with proper syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; Possibly no semicolons inside braces. Or we could use braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } Let's output the corrected code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Provide inside triple backticks.

But they said "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They want us to rely only on the error message. But we are allowed to produce the corrected code.

So answer: code block with fixed code. Let's provide:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe they'd prefer braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The error mentions unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code shows `else b = 2; 》`. That means after else there is 》, so the statement might be considered closed. The correct is to close with `}` if braces are used.

But original code didn't have braces. The delimiters `《` `》` are not recognized, so they produce errors.

Thus simplest fix: replace 《 with `{` and 》 with `}`. So we get: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That will compile.

Let's output that.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
