Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)

We must produce fixed code only. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". It contains symbols: [, ], (, ), space, quotes, etc. We cannot use other symbols maybe not present in message. They want us to use only symbols that appear in error message. So we can only use these characters: u,n,e,x,p,e,c,t,e,d, space, ']' (closing bracket), after, else, clause, (, if, statement, already, closed. Actually the error message contains a lot of letters but we cannot add new symbols like { } ; = < >. We can use those that appear in message: letters, digits, space, punctuation: [, ], (, ), ;? The message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". It includes a single quote and parentheses. Also includes ; maybe not? It has no ;. But the code originally has ; inside. We might need to keep ;. But ; is not in error message. But maybe we cannot use ;. The requirement: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Means we can use those symbols, but maybe we can use others if needed? It's ambiguous. Let's just produce fixed code using only brackets, parentheses, quotes, letters. Let's rewrite: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. This uses [] and parentheses. But '=' is not in error message. Also >, ;, = not present. Maybe we can still use them. But "if statement already closed" indicates the extra ']' after else clause. So the fix is to remove that last ']'. Also the else part missing brackets. Maybe we need to close else part with ']' but original had extra. We can fix: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]` and remove final ']'. Wait the code originally: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So else part not bracketed, then ']' at end. So fix: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. That has no extra ']' at end. But still have '[' after else. This might be correct.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ] 
```
