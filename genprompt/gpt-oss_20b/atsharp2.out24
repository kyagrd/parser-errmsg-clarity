Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. They used `@` after if? Syntax different. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, if already closed. Likely need to remove '#' after else or modify. They want using only error message symbols. Use '#'? They want to fix using symbols that appear in error message. Error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So use '#' maybe to comment? But they already used '# else b = 2; #'. Maybe the code should be: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. Remove trailing '#' characters. Also remove '#' after else? Wait they used '# else b = 2; #'. So else and code then comment. So fix: remove '#' and keep else b = 2; So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the syntax also has '@' maybe weird. But we just fix error. Output only code inside triple backticks.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Check: else clause after closing. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if already closed). Removing '#' after else solves. Good.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
