Thinking...
We have error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra '}' after else clause. Also else clause missing braces but that's fine if only one statement. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the original had `else b = 2; }` meaning after else b = 2; then extra }. To fix, we can add braces around else body, and remove the extra '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or we can close the if early: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` but then still need closing? Actually if we remove the extra '}', it would compile. So two ways. Using braces is safer. So produce code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
