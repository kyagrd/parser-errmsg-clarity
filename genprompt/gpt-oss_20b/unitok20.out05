Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message? The error message is just "syntax error". Not helpful. But we must use symbols that appear in the error message if available. The error message is "syntax error" no symbols. So we can't use any new symbol? We must output fixed code.

We need to guess language: The code uses `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. So they used 《 and 》 as brackets. We need to replace them with proper braces or parentheses. Use typical syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we need to output only that inside triple backquotes. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
