Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Looks like syntax uses `@` maybe for then? Maybe the correct syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #`? Or maybe `@` is wrong, replace with `then`. But only using symbols that appear in error message "syntax error". That message has words syntax and error. We can maybe use `syntax` or `error` as keywords? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains "syntax error". So symbols: `syntax` and `error`. Maybe use them as identifiers? We need code that is syntactically correct. Could use `syntax` as variable? But code originally uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Maybe `@` is the problematic token. So replace `@` with something like `then`. But `then` not in error message. But maybe `error` is keyword? Not typical. We could use `syntax` as operator? This is ambiguous.

Maybe simpler: remove `@`. So code becomes `if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. That is syntactically correct if language supports assignment after if without braces. The `#` comments maybe okay. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Provide in triple backticks.

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
