Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses some custom delimiters: 《 and 》 around statements. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the structure likely should be:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》?

But the else clause has b = 2; 》 but missing opening 《. So we need to add 《 before else block? Wait the syntax: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The closing 》 after else is unexpected because the if statement is closed already. So else block should be inside its own delimiters. Probably: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Also there is a stray 》 after else? So fix: replace else b = 2; 》 with else 《 b = 2; 》. Also remove trailing space? So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That should compile.

Thus output the fixed code.
...done thinking.

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
