Thinking...
We have a code snippet with syntax error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses some weird characters 《 and 》 as code block delimiters? Actually the snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

So we need to fix the syntax error, only using the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we still know that if statement syntax in many languages: if (condition) { statements } else { statements }.

The weird characters are used to delimit code blocks? They appear to be some kind of parentheses maybe used for code formatting? So we need to replace 《 and 》 with proper curly braces or semicolons? The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means the parser reached else but considered the if closed prematurely. Because the '》' ended the if block incorrectly. We should replace 《 and 》 with curly braces {} or maybe remove them altogether. The snippet likely intended to write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But given the error says after else clause, the if statement already closed. So the '》' after the first block ended the if block. So we need to replace '》' with '}' but maybe the parser is complaining that the if already closed? Let's parse: "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》" In many languages, after the if clause, you can have a single statement like a = 1; The '《' and '》' appear to be delimiters used incorrectly. If we replace them with braces: "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }" That last '}' would close something else. Actually we need to close the else block as well: else { b = 2; } So we should have two braces. So final code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But we need to output only the fixed code in triple backquotes. Provide code. Use the same language as original: probably some pseudo-code or maybe JavaScript. So produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes. That addresses the syntax error. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
