Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

We need to fix by using only error message. The error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we likely need to remove the stray '}'. After else clause, we shouldn't have a '}'. So fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;   That's it. But maybe need braces for else? The code might be syntax of unknown language. The original code had if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } . We remove last }. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; . Also maybe need semicolon? It's already semicolon after else assignment. Good. Provide only fixed code inside triple backquote.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
