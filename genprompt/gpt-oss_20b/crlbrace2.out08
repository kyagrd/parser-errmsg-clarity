Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block. Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. DO NOT output your "thinking" process. ONLY output what was asked."

We must provide just the fixed code. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
So the extra closing brace after the else statement. We need to remove the last '}'. Also, else clause syntax is probably wrong: else expects block, but maybe we can just remove brace. The only error we can fix with the symbol '}' is remove the last '}'. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
Thus output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
