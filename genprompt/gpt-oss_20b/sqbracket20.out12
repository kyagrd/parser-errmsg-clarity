Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

It seems they used brackets incorrectly. Suppose they want to use parentheses for condition, curly braces for blocks. Maybe just change brackets to parentheses? But instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is "syntax error" which doesn't contain symbols. So we just fix the code. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Should we maintain same structure? Likely we need to close brackets properly. The code has mismatched brackets: after else there's no block, and there's an extra ']' at the end. We can fix by using parentheses and braces.

Maybe the syntax they intended is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But original uses square brackets. If they want to keep brackets, maybe:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Yes that would match pairs. So we remove extra closing bracket at the end. So code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
