Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to correct syntax: remove the stray '}' after else clause. Also else needs braces or a single statement: else b = 2; is fine. So remove final }.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return only that code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
