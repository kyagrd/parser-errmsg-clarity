Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: after else clause, there's an extra closing brace '}'. The if statement already closed. So we need to remove the trailing '}'. Also the else clause is not using braces. But maybe we should keep consistency. They ask: "Fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can only use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The only symbols present are '}'. The message indicates unexpected '}' after else clause. So we need to remove '}'. The code after removal:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's the fixed code. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
