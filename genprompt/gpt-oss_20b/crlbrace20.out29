Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. There's a syntax error. The code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to fix syntax error. The error message: "syntax error". We need to use symbols from error message if available. The error message is just "syntax error". It contains words "syntax", "error". The instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That might mean we can only use characters that appear in "syntax error" (letters s y n t a x e r). But we need to produce a corrected code that compiles. However we cannot output our thinking, only output the fixed code.

We need to close the braces correctly. The original code has an extra closing brace at the end. Also the else statement is missing braces around assignment. The corrected version might be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But that uses braces, parentheses, etc. The error message didn't provide them. But we can still use braces. The instruction "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That might not restrict us. It says try to use symbols that appear in the error message, but not required. The error message is "syntax error". The code uses parentheses, braces, semicolons. Those are fine. The syntax error likely due to mismatched braces. The fix is to remove the extra } at the end. Also need else block braces? Actually code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` This has an extra } at the end, but the else statement without braces is allowed in many languages: `if (cond) {...} else b = 2;` It's okay if else is followed by a single statement, but the syntax might need braces? In C, you can have `else b = 2;`? Wait C requires a statement after else; `b = 2;` is a statement, so it's fine. The syntax error is probably due to an unmatched brace: There's an opening `{` after `if` and a closing `}` after the else statement, but there's an extra closing `}` at the end: So the code has one opening `{` and two closing `}`. So we need to remove the last `}`.

Thus the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we also might want to wrap else statement in braces for readability, but not necessary. The key is to remove the stray }.

Thus output only the code block. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Make sure no trailing spaces. Done.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
