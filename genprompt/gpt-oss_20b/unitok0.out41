Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, only using error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we can still infer what code should look like. The code given:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems the code uses some wrong bracket characters: Chinese angle brackets 《 and 》 instead of curly braces. So we need to replace them with correct braces. The code likely should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But might also accept without braces because single statements: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the original had braces replaced by 《 》. So we just replace with curly braces. Also there might be stray `>` at end. Actually the code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》` There is an extra closing bracket `>` at end. Should be `}`. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus output only that code in triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
