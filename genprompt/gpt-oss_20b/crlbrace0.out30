Thinking...
We have error: syntax error due to mismatched braces. Code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra closing brace at end. Also else statement syntax: else must be followed by statement or block. In this code else b = 2; is fine but braces mismatched. Let's fix: remove trailing '}'. So code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That is correct. Alternatively maybe add braces for else: else { b = 2; }. But syntax error only because of extra '}'. Removing it solves. Provide fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
