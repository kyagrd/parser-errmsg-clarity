Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, using only the error message. But we can produce corrected code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have mismatched braces: if block has opening brace after (x > 0), closed before else. Else has no braces. Extra closing brace at end.

Fix: either remove extra brace or add braces around else. The simplest: remove the last brace. Also maybe put else with braces for consistency. But simplest: remove last brace.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need braces for else? But not required.

The syntax error arises from stray '}'. So removal will fix.

Thus output the fixed code.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
