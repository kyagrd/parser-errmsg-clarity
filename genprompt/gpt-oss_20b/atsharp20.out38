Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code in triple backticks. The code had syntax error. We need to fix syntax using only the error message, which is just "syntax error". That is a generic. We can try to interpret the code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We suspect that the "@" is invalid. Maybe replace "@" with "then" or "="? The note: syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages. Try to fix error using symbols that appear in error message, if available. Error message only says syntax error, no symbols. So we can't use symbol from message. But we can fix the code by removing the "@" and the comment delimiters '#'. Maybe use semicolons. We can restructure: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But we need to preserve some syntax: maybe the language uses "@" for else? But the code had "@" before assignment. That seems wrong. So remove '@' and maybe the '# else' comment was wrong. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
Wait we might need to keep comment? The note says syntax may be different. But we should output the fixed code.

Probably correct: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
But that's still same. We need to fix syntax. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
