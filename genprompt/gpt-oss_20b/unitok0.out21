Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code uses Chinese angle brackets 《 and 》, and maybe stray brackets. Should replace with standard parentheses and braces. Code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Probably intention: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. So correct syntax. Output only fixed code inside triple backquote.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
