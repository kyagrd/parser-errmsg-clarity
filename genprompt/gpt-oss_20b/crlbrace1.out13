Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace after else clause. The error message indicates unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove that closing brace.

Also, we may need to format else correctly. In C-like languages, else must have braces if block. But we can write else b = 2; no braces. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Thus we just remove the final '}'. So final code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
