Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax. The typical if statement uses parentheses for condition, braces for block. Here we have square brackets and mismatched brackets. The error indicates unexpected ']' after else clause, because the if statement already closed but there's an extra ']'.

So we need to remove the extra ']' at the end. Also use curly braces. But requirement: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They want to fix the syntax using the error message. But the error message indicates unexpected ']' after else clause. So remove that bracket.

We also might need to change the block delimiters. But the minimal change: replace square brackets with braces or just remove them? But if we remove all brackets, we might get:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

This is valid in many languages like C-like. But if the code originally used brackets, maybe they intended braces. But the error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means the compiler thought the if block ended at the first ']' after `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`. Then it saw `else b = 2; ]` and the trailing `]` is unexpected.

So we could simply remove the trailing `]`:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But the square brackets are not typical. But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They likely expect minimal change to correct error: remove trailing bracket. But also maybe convert square brackets to braces. But the error message didn't mention mismatched brackets earlier. The code uses square brackets; maybe it's purposely incorrect. We can fix by replacing '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'. But then we would still have an extra ']' at the end. We remove that. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But is the else block necessary? In many languages, you can put a single statement after else. But to maintain consistency, use braces. But we might want minimal changes. The error message indicates only the unexpected ']' after else clause. So we could simply remove that trailing bracket. But the code uses mismatched brackets. It may compile in some languages with square brackets? In C, square brackets are not used for blocks, so they'd be errors. So likely we need braces. The error message maybe from a language that uses square brackets? Unlikely. Let's assume it's a generic code snippet with a mistake. The fix: replace square brackets with curly braces and remove extra bracket.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe they want only removing trailing bracket and keeping square brackets? But that still wrong in C. But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error". Could be just removing trailing bracket. But the code uses square brackets for blocks, which may not be correct. But it's not a syntax error for some languages like JavaScript: square brackets are used for array access, not block. So the error would be different. I think they want minimal fix: remove the last ']' after else. Let's output that.

But the instruction: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So we need to output just the code. Let's give:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that still has square brackets. But maybe that's fine. But maybe we want to use braces. The error message didn't mention other syntax issues. I'd lean to minimal change: remove trailing ']':

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But I'd also change the brackets to braces for correctness. Let's choose the latter.

The safe answer: replace square brackets with curly braces and remove trailing bracket. Provide:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But else block still missing braces. But it's okay to have single statement. But to keep symmetrical, use braces.

Given typical expectation: fix by replacing `[` and `]` with `{` and `}` respectively and removing the stray `]`. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
