Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output only fixed code in triple backticks. We cannot use pre-trained knowledge? They say "without using the pre-trained knowledge." But we have to use error message. The error message is "syntax error". The code has an extra closing brace at end. Also else branch missing braces? In many languages, else b = 2; is fine if language supports; but we might need braces. But error is syntax due to stray '}'. So remove the last '}'. Also maybe else without braces is fine. But maybe need braces around else? But no, we can keep as is. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
