Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error only using the error message, but we are to produce fixed code. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to correct syntax. It's a C-like syntax. Use braces. The stray closing bracket at end. Probably:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Make sure no stray brackets. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
