Thinking...
We have an error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

It uses square brackets instead of braces. Likely they want to close the else properly. The extra ']' after else. Should be: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ].

Thus remove the last ']' after else block. Actually the code currently: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. There's an unmatched ']' after else. Should be: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. That fixes.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
