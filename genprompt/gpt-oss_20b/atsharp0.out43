Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, only using error message "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge, but we must produce fixed code. We must guess what code is intended. There's an if statement with some syntax mistakes: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". So errors: "@" instead of "=" maybe? The else part is commented out incorrectly. In many languages (C/C++/Java), correct syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; No need for '@'. Also remove comments '#'. So final code:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Alternatively could be a code block.

Thus we output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Given instructions: Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. No explanation.

So produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
