Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Original code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

This is obviously wrong. We need to use only the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the error indicates that there's an unexpected closing bracket ']' after else clause. The correct syntax for if-else in many languages uses braces {} or parentheses or just statements. The code uses brackets [ ] incorrectly. So fix: change brackets to braces. Also remove the trailing ']' at end.

Thus fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But else part currently "b = 2;" no braces; that's fine but we might want braces for consistency. The error message indicates else clause already closed, so we can close it properly. So final:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively just use else { b = 2; }. Yes.

Return only code block.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
