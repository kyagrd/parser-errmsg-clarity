Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We are told to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. But basically the syntax is wrong: There's an `@` symbol and comments `# else b = 2; #`. Possibly the language is C-like or Python? The syntax error likely arises due to the `@` and the stray comments. The task: output only the fixed code in triple backticks. We need to guess correct syntax: maybe remove `@` and remove the `#` comments. Maybe write:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

If it's Python, the syntax is different. But it's likely C-like: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. So fix: remove `@` and replace with maybe `=`? Actually it's already assignment. The `@` maybe should be removed. Also the `#` comments maybe are not needed. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

If it's Python, we would need colon and indentation, but error message is generic syntax error. We'll provide C-like. So answer.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
