Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems they used some weird brackets 《 》 instead of curly braces or just code block. The error message is generic. We have to use ONLY the error message? They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we should only look at the error message "syntax error" and maybe deduce from context? But we need to produce fixed code.

I think we can guess correct code: Use proper if syntax:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

Maybe we don't need braces if single statements but with else need braces? Actually C-like syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` This is valid. But they had weird brackets causing syntax error.

Thus the fix: Replace 《 and 》 with braces or remove them. Let's use braces for clarity:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively, just remove all the extra brackets:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But original had `《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》` maybe they tried to use "begin-end" style? We can keep it as one line: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` This compiles.

But I'll output the fixed code inside triple backticks. Probably we need to use correct brackets.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
