Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace at end, plus else syntax missing braces. The syntax is similar to C/Java. So correct could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Remove stray } at end. That should be correct. Use only symbols from error message? error message is just "syntax error". That says nothing. But we can still use usual braces. Should we output code in triple backquotes. Only output code. So final answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
