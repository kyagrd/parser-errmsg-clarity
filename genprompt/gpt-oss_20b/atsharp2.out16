Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We see a hash symbol after else clause. So we should remove the '#' after else b = 2; or before else? The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely the '#' after else is wrong. Also there is '#' at end. So we should remove them. Also the syntax uses "@"? Might be some language. But we only need to fix syntax error. So the corrected code might be:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But also the '#' before else? The code had "# else b = 2; #". So we remove the leading '#'. So final code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
Check: after else b = 2; no trailing '#'. Should be fine. So output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
