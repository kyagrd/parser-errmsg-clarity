Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code snippet uses strange symbols: "《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". The error message says syntax error. We are told not to use pre-trained knowledge but only the error message? But we can deduce that code uses "if (x > 0)" but then uses "《" and "》" as delimiters maybe? So we can replace "《" with "{" and "》" with "}". The else is inside? The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. There's an extra closing delimiter at end. So we might write: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. So fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
We output only that inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
