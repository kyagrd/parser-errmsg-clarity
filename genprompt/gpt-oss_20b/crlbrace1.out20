Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
So there's an extra closing brace at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But might need braces for else block: else { b = 2; } but the error refers to unexpected '}' after else clause, if statement already closed. In given code, after else clause, we close else block with '}'. Actually else clause doesn't have braces, but we have '}'. That is the extra. So remove the final '}'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Should we include else block braces? Not necessary. But maybe we need to wrap else: else { b = 2; }. But the error specifically: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)" indicates that there is an extra '}'. The code already closed the if statement with '}' before else. So correct code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively we could wrap else in braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That would also be correct. But they mention that if statement already closed. The fix: remove the stray brace. So produce the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
