Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code, using only error message. Code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We should produce code inside triple backticks. Use proper syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

But also need to close braces properly. There's an extra closing bracket at the end.

So fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

We need output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. No explanation. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
