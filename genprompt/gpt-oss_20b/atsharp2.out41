Thinking...
We have an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message? The error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So '#' appears. We must produce fixed code inside triple backticks.

The syntax may be arbitrary. The original code uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause because if statement already closed. So we likely need to remove the '#' after else, or move the else inside. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe use `#`? But the error is unexpected '#' after else clause, so maybe remove the second '#', or replace with something else. But we are only allowed to use symbols that appear in error message: '#', 'unexpected', 'after', 'else', 'clause', 'if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed', parentheses, maybe spaces. They said to try to fix error using symbols that appear in the error message. So we can use '#', parentheses, maybe semicolons. But we need to remove the stray '#'. The code should be something like:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they said use only error message symbols. 'else' is present, so we can keep else. '# ' appears in error message but we might not need it. We might keep the '#' after if? The code uses '@' after if, weird. But maybe '@' is part of syntax. We can keep that. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. We could also close with '#', but maybe remove it. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the '#'. The final code inside triple backticks.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
