Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That's odd: we are to use ONLY the error message, i.e., "syntax error". But we can still infer what the code should be. We must not use pre-trained knowledge? But we are ChatGPT, we have knowledge. The instruction is to only use the error message? This seems contradictory. But we can assume that we are to correct the syntax error by making the code syntactically correct. The code uses Chinese brackets 《 and 》. It is likely they want to replace those with proper parentheses or braces.

Original code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Maybe they want to use curly braces {}? But the code seems to attempt to use brackets but incorrectly. The correct syntax in Java or C is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But they might want a single statement after if: then `a = 1;` else `b = 2;`. So code could be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the problem: They used 《 and 》 around the statements. So we must replace them with proper curly braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, if they want only minimal change, we could replace 《 with `{` and 》 with `}`. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

But we need to ensure braces balanced. Actually code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

has an extra closing brace. So better to write:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes. So we output that.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
