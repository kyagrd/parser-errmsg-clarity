Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code using ONLY the error message. Error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

So syntax uses 《 and 》 as some delimiters? Likely they want to replace 《 with '{' and 》 with '}'. The error indicates unexpected '》' after else clause: else b = 2; 》. It seems the closing '》' after else clause is unexpected because if statement already closed. The correct syntax might be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we must only use symbols that appear in error message: '》' and maybe '《'. But we can use '》' as closing bracket. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause, so we might remove that '》' after else. And maybe missing '《' before else block? The code originally: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The first 《 starts block for if, then 》 closes. The else then just b = 2; 》 - but that last 》 is unnecessary. So the fix: remove the trailing '》' after else. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But the else part may need its own delimiters? The error indicates after else clause if statement already closed, so the extra '》' after else is causing error. So simply remove that. So final code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.
