Thinking...
We need to produce the fixed code. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The original code uses 《 and 》 as some brackets. The syntax is like:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after else b=2; there is a 》 which is unexpected.

We need to fix using only error message, so we can only use the symbols that appear in error message: '》'. The error message references '》'. So we can use 》 to close the else clause perhaps? But error says after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe we need to remove the last 》 or add an opening one earlier? Let's think: The structure seems to use 《 ... 》 as a block. For if we have:

if (condition) 《 ... 》 else 《 ... 》 ?

But the code uses else b = 2; 》 with no opening. So maybe we need to replace that 》 with 《 for else block and close it at the end. Let's try: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 . That seems symmetrical. So we change else b = 2; 》 to else 《 b = 2; 》.

Thus code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》.

That should fix syntax error.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. No commentary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
