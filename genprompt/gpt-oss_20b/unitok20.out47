Thinking...
We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. The error: syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We have weird symbols 《 and 》. Probably meant to be angle brackets? Maybe it's a custom language where 《 means start block, 》 means end block? But they used `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. There's an extra 》 at end. Should be `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`? Or remove the final 》. The syntax error likely due to mismatched delimiters. So fix by balancing. The code inside triple backquotes should be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

That is one 》 after else. But we also need a matching 》 for else. In original, there was `else b = 2; 》`. So we need an opening 《 before b. So final:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Return that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
