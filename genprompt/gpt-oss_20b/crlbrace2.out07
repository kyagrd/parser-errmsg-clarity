Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace '}' at the end. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause, if statement already closed. So we need to remove the extra '}'. But note that we need to fix the code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But the instruction is "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". We have '}' in the error message, we can remove it. But the output should be the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We can output that. That would fix the syntax error. Should we add braces for else? The code originally has else b = 2; which is fine if language allows. They want to use symbols that appear in the error message. The only symbol there is '}'. We just remove it. So final code is as above.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
