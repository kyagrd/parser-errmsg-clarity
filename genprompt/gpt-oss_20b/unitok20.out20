Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code uses symbols: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The syntax seems like a custom language uses 《 and 》 to delimit blocks? The error message: syntax error. We need to use symbols that appear in error message: "syntax error" doesn't contain symbols. So can't help.

But we must use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Since error message contains no symbols, we cannot use any special symbols. So we might have to correct syntax using typical language syntax? But they say syntax may be different. We need to produce corrected code using only symbols that appear in the error message. The error message "syntax error" contains letters and space. So only allowed symbols are letters s,y,n,t,a,x, space, e,r. But code uses parentheses and semicolons. They are not allowed? Wait: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot rely on knowledge of language, just rely on error message. That might be trick: we can't know what correct syntax is. But maybe we can produce a minimal code that avoids syntax error: remove unsupported symbols and keep only allowed ones? Could produce: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; That still uses parentheses etc. Not allowed? The rule about using only symbols that appear in error message might mean we must use only characters from error message? That's odd.

Let's interpret: We should only use symbols that appear in the error message. Error message contains characters: s, y, n, t, a, x, space, e, r. No punctuation. So we cannot use parentheses, brackets, angle brackets, etc. So we need to rewrite code only using letters and space. So we can produce: if x greater than 0 a equals 1 else b equals 2. But that may still be syntax error. But we are asked to fix syntax error. The code above uses unusual 《》. Maybe the language expects 《 >, but we can't use those symbols. Without knowledge can't fix. Maybe we can simply remove the 《 and 》, leaving: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But that still uses punctuation. But maybe syntax error arises due to mismatched 《 》. Remove them may fix.

Thus fixed code: 
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Let's output inside triple backquotes.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
