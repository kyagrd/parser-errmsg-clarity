Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. The code uses symbols: 《 and 》. The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the else clause incorrectly has a closing 》 before the statement. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems the syntax uses 《 to open a block and 》 to close a block. In the if, we open with 《 after condition, then a = 1; then close with 》. After else, the else clause should also open with 《 and close with 》, but the code has "else b = 2; 》" missing opening 《 before b. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to add a 《 before b = 2; and close the block with 》. Also maybe remove the final 》 after the else? Let's examine. The current code ends with ` 》`. That's the final closing of something. We need to reformat:

`if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`

Thus final 》 after else. So code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

We output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
