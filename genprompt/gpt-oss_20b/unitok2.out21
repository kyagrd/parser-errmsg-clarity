Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses non-standard symbols 《 and 》. Error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. So we need to close the else block? But maybe we need to replace 《 with { and 》 with }? But they said try to use symbols that appear in error message. The error mentions '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely need to remove the extra closing '》' after else. The code currently: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The last '》' is extraneous. Should remove. Also maybe need to close the if block after else? But the error says after else clause, if statement already closed. So remove the '》' after else. So fixed: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; . But maybe need to close else with '》'? Actually else clause is b = 2; 》. The else has a closing '》'. But if the else clause was not started with a block, maybe need to add opening '《' before b = 2;? But the code uses 《 for opening a block. The else should also have block: else 《 b = 2; 》. But current has else b = 2; 》 (closing after). That likely triggers error because block not opened. So we need to add opening 《 before b = 2. But we also need to close the if? Already closed after a = 1; 》. So after else we need to add 《 before b = 2 and then 》 after. And remove the trailing '》' at end. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
