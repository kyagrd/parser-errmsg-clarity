Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So just produce the corrected code.

The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

This appears to be C or Java-like syntax, but there are errors: use of '@' where likely 'then' or missing braces, the comment syntax '# else b = 2; #' is weird: '#' used as comment but also includes else.

Maybe they intended a C-like syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or maybe it's JavaScript: same. The '@' is wrong. And the '#' are wrong as comments. So correct: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

So final code: ```if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;```

Wrap in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
