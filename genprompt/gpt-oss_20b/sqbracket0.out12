Thinking...
We have a prompt: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is a meta instruction: we cannot use pre-trained knowledge? But we as ChatGPT are a large model. The instruction: "without using the pre-trained knowledge" means we need to rely only on the error message provided. But the error message is simply "syntax error". We cannot read the code? But we have the code. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message only says syntax error. That doesn't give details. But we need to fix the code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote. So we should produce corrected code. Let's analyze.

The code seems to intend:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But there's a stray closing bracket ']' at the end. Also the opening bracket for the if clause uses '[' instead of '{', and missing braces for else part. Also stray bracket at end.

Given the instruction to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message. But we only have a generic syntax error. We can't use pre-trained knowledge? That's ambiguous. But I think we are allowed to use code knowledge to fix.

We output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's the fixed code. No extra commentary.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
