Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace after else clause. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). We should remove the stray '}'. The code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But also maybe the else clause missing braces? In many languages else should have braces if multiple statements, but here it's single assignment so okay. So final code is that. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
