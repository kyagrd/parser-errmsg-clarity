Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code has `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we must remove the stray ']' at the end. Also syntax: In C/C++ style, if requires parentheses and braces; but code uses brackets []. So we change to correct syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That is typical. The message only mentions error, but we can fix accordingly. Also maybe they want minimal change: replace [ with {, and ] with }. And remove extra ]. The code originally: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So fix: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So output inside triple backticks. Let's provide only fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
