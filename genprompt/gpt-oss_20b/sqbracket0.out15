Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The original code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We want valid code. Probably intended to be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus use curly braces. Also remove stray bracket at end. Provide only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
