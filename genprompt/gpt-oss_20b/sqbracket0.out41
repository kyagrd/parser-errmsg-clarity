Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. The code uses C-like syntax but with square brackets. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to correct syntax using only error message, but we don't have other instructions. So just fix to valid code. We can choose language: perhaps JavaScript or C? The code uses if statement with brackets. Replace square brackets with braces and add missing braces.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But also remove stray ']' at end. So output only fixed code inside triple backticks. Let's output as:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
