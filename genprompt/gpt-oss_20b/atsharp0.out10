Thinking...
The user wants us to fix the syntax error in the code using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we have pre-trained knowledge. They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should not rely on knowledge of C syntax. But we can infer from the error message "syntax error" and the code snippet. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to produce a fixed code snippet. It seems like the original code is intended to be a C-style if statement. The "@" and "#" are wrong. The correct code should be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to use braces? The simplest is:

```
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
```

Thus we remove the invalid tokens '@' and '#'. Provide the fixed code. The instructions: Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So respond with:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

or the block version. The user didn't specify formatting. Provide code block. So final.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
