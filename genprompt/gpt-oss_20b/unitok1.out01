Thinking...
We need to produce corrected code. The original code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
It seems like using weird brackets '《' and '》' which likely should be parentheses or braces. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe the correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } or maybe semicolons? The original used '《 a = 1; 》' as body of if, and then 'else b = 2;' and then a trailing '》'. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause. So fix by closing earlier or removing trailing. The correct code likely: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Return just that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
