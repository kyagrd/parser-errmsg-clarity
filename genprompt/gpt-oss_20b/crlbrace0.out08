Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Problems: 
- else block missing braces or assignment is wrong: `else b = 2;` needs braces or semicolon? Should be `else { b = 2; }`. 
- There's an extra closing brace at the end: the `}` after else block? There's also an opening brace after if. Let's parse: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } 
Open braces: one after if, one after else? There's none. So the final } is unmatched. So we need to remove the final } or add opening brace. Standard style: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Thus fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Return only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
