Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So after else b = 2; there's an extra '}'.

We need to remove the stray '}'. The syntax may differ, but likely remove the last '}'. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return that code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
