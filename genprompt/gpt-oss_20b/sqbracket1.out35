Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code given: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the problem is syntax: in many languages, brackets `[]` are not used for code blocks; use `{}`. Also there's an extra `]` at the end. Also else clause syntax might need braces if multiple statements. So correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or just `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But they want only the fixed code inside triple backticks. They mention "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge". That suggests we can't rely on other knowledge; but we can produce the fixed code. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Make sure no trailing semicolons incorrectly. The original had semicolons inside the braces. So final answer: triple backticks code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
