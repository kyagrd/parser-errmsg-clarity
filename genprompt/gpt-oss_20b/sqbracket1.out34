Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

They provide an error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)

Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So we need to produce a corrected code. The error: Unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code currently uses brackets for code blocks incorrectly. Should use braces. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But might need semicolons. They might want to keep semicolons inside braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We also need to ensure it's syntactically correct. The else block should have braces. And the semicolons. Also ensure no trailing ']' after else. So final code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also we can keep the trailing semicolons inside braces. That's fine. No trailing ']' after else. So answer.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
