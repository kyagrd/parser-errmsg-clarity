Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We have an error message: "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They mention "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. DO NOT output your 'thinking' process. ONLY output what was asked."

So we need to output the fixed code inside triple backquote. The instruction "using ONLY the error message" means we cannot use knowledge of languages. We only have the error message "syntax error". So we cannot deduce specifics. But maybe we can use symbols from the error message, but there are none: just the words "syntax error". We might need to replace the weird 《 and 》 brackets with something else like parentheses or braces.

But maybe the instruction "using ONLY the error message" means we can't refer to pre-trained knowledge; we can only use the error message to fix syntax. The error message "syntax error" is generic, doesn't point to what is wrong.

But we must produce a corrected code snippet that likely compiles. The code seems like C style: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; But they used 《 and 》. So we need to replace them with {}. Also need a semicolon after else block maybe. The else part is b = 2; Should be enclosed in braces too: else { b = 2; }.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But they might want to keep the style of using 《 and 》? The instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we might not know that {} is needed. But we can only use symbols in error message: "syntax error" includes only letters and space. So we can't use braces. But the instruction also says "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we can't assume any language. But we have to fix syntax error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. So we could use the characters in the error message: s y n t a x e r r o r . The only punctuation is space. So we cannot change brackets.

Thus maybe we should keep the same brackets but adjust placement. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The extra 》 at the end seems wrong. Maybe correct code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

That is, use same brackets to delimit blocks. That uses only the same symbols.

Thus we replace the stray 》 at the end with opening bracket. So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`.

This uses only symbols appearing in original code and doesn't use pre-trained knowledge.

Thus answer: triple backticks with code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
