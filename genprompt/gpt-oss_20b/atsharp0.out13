Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #"

We have to use ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge? They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems like a trick. But we have the error message: "syntax error". We must fix code. So we need to produce a valid code snippet.

Original code looks like some C-like or C++ style: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". The syntax errors are: '@' instead of '{', '#' is probably comments but not valid syntax in C. So we need to convert to valid syntax: "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }". Maybe we need to keep semicolons. Provide code snippet.

So final output should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wrap in triple backticks.

Check: maybe the code uses a different language? Could be like shell? But likely C. Provide final code.

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
