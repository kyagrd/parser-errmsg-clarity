Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

It has mismatched brackets. The syntax likely: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. The error message says syntax error. We need to output only fixed code. Use only symbols that appear in error message? Error message is just "syntax error". But they say "try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can use the word "syntax" or "error"? Hmm. They want us to use symbols that appear in the error message. The message only contains letters and space. So maybe use the same words? But code syntax needs brackets and semicolons. We can use the same symbols: we need parentheses, brackets, semicolons, etc. But "symbols that appear in the error message" maybe nothing else. I think we just correct brackets:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
