Thinking...
We have code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means there is an extra '}'. The else clause syntax should be like `else { b = 2; }` or maybe `else b = 2;` but then no closing bracket. So we should remove the last '}' or adjust. The error suggests the if statement already closed: we had closing `}` after `if`. Then we had `else b = 2; }`. So we need to remove the final '}'. So the fixed code would be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That should compile in some language. But we also need to check if else needs braces: else without braces is okay if only one statement. The code currently: `else b = 2;` is fine. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`.

We output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
