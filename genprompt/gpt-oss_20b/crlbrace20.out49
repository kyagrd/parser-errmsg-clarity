Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, which just says "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax. Likely unmatched braces. The code has an opening brace after if, and then closing brace after else assignment. But there is an extra closing brace at end. Also else branch missing braces: else b = 2; should be else { b = 2; } or else b = 2; but still need to close the if block. Let's examine:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

The if block is: (x > 0) { a = 1; } that's fine. Then else b = 2; is okay in many languages? In C, else must be followed by a statement, so else b = 2; is allowed. But we have an extra closing brace at the end. So just remove that final }.

But the code might be considered erroneous because after else we have a semicolon after the assignment, then a brace. The final brace is unmatched. So remove it.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But need to ensure there is a closing brace for the if block? The if block already had its own closing brace. The else block is just a statement. So no more braces needed.

Thus output that.

But maybe they want to add braces around else? But it's optional. So final code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Ensure no syntax error.

Thus output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
