Thinking...
We have error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax using symbols from error message: ']' appears. We can restructure to make the code valid, but we can only use symbols from error message? It says "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message has: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So ']' and maybe 'if', 'else', parentheses. We can use brackets '[]', parentheses '()' etc.

We need to fix to proper syntax. Let's assume we need to close the if properly and maybe remove the trailing ]. We can replace ']' with something else? Maybe using '}'? But '}' not in error message. So we should keep ']' only. Maybe we can restructure:

`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ];` This still ends with ; . But we still have trailing ']'? Actually the original had ']' after the else block. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause. So we need to remove that trailing ']'. So we can rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But we still have mismatched brackets? The if part: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]` uses brackets to enclose a. That's okay. The else part: `else b = 2;` no brackets. Should be okay. The closing ']' removed.

So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`

Let's output with triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
