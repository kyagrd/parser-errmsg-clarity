Thinking...
The user has code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses square brackets incorrectly. Standard C/C++/Java uses parentheses for condition and braces for block. The code has a stray closing bracket after else clause. The error message indicates that else clause already closed. So fix by removing brackets and the stray closing bracket. We should produce code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But perhaps they want minimal change: replace [ with { and remove stray ] after else. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe they want both braces. It's ambiguous. The error message says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The last ']' after else is unexpected. We can just remove that. Also the [ and ] should be replaced with braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus output only fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
