Thinking...
We need to output fixed code inside triple backticks. The code originally: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } . There's an extra closing brace at end. The syntax may be non-standard but we can fix by removing the extra '}'. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; . That might be acceptable. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
