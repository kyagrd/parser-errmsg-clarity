Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code given:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

There is mismatched brackets. Possibly correct is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But they say syntax may be different; use symbols that appear in error message? The error message is just "syntax error". No specific symbols. But we can adjust brackets: use parentheses and braces? They used parentheses for condition. They used [ ] for block. There's an extra closing bracket at end. So correct: remove trailing bracket. Also else block missing brackets? The else block uses no brackets but then semicolon then ] extra. Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Now brackets match. Remove trailing bracket. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
