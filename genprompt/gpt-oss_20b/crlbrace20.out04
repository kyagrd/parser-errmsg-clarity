Thinking...
The user wants us to "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is weird: We must fix the syntax error using only the error message: "syntax error". But we can still guess the intended language: It's like C syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }. There is an unmatched brace: after else block missing braces. Also an extra closing brace. We need to produce code that compiles. But the instructions: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains just "syntax error". There's no symbol. So we cannot use symbols from the error message because there are none. So we might just fix the error.

Also the user said: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block. DO NOT output your 'thinking' process. ONLY output what was asked." So we must output the fixed code inside triple backticks. Also we cannot output any explanation. Just the fixed code.

We need to fix the code. Let's do:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we need to close braces appropriately. The original had an extra } after else block. We'll remove it.

Thus the fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

So output that inside triple backticks.

Ok.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
