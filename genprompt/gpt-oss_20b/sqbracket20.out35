Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to correct. Use braces? The code uses brackets `[ ]` instead of `{ }`. Also extra closing bracket at end. The error message only "syntax error". We must use only symbols that appear in error message? It says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge". The error message is "syntax error". That has symbols: maybe "syntax error" includes letters, space, maybe no symbols. This is confusing. But we just need to fix code. So correct to:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But need to remove trailing ]. Actually original has `]` at end. So we can remove that. Also maybe brackets correct. Use:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But missing closing bracket? Actually we open `[`, close `]` after a=1. Then else [ b=2; ] - open else bracket then close. So final has balanced brackets. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
