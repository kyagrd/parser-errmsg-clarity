Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. So we must parse the code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That indicates an extra closing bracket after else clause. So we need to remove that extra `]`. Also the syntax uses brackets incorrectly; typically if uses parentheses and braces or not but for this example maybe it's pseudo code. Use the same style: use brackets `[ ]` for code block. But we can keep them.

Given code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. We need to produce fixed code:

`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` But we also might need to remove the trailing semicolon after else statement? But semicolon after else is okay. But maybe we need to keep brackets symmetrical: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`? The original had else with no brackets. But the error was after else clause. So the trailing `]` after else b = 2; ] is extra.

Thus fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. Let's output.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 
```
