Thinking...
The user requests to fix the syntax error in the code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. They give the error message: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. We must fix syntax. Let's examine. In many languages, the syntax `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` is incorrect. The `@` symbol is not a keyword; maybe they meant `a = 1`. Also the comment syntax uses `#`, which is python style, but the code uses C-like `if (x > 0)`. So we need to decide a language. Probably the intention is C or C-like code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So we need to remove the `@` and the trailing comment marks. So the corrected code is:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But if we want to keep the comment style, we can use `//` or `/* */`. But simplest: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They want to fix syntax. Possibly they want to change the `@` to `=`? Actually it's `@ a = 1`. That is wrong. Replace `@` with nothing. Remove the hash signs. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #` replaced with `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

We output only that code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
