Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error message says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code has a '#' that is wrong. The syntax is probably from C or JavaScript. But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only can rely on error message. But we can figure: The code has stray '#', comment? In many languages '#' is comment char. But the else clause comment may be mis-placed. The code maybe:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;

But there's '@' incorrectly? Actually '@' may be error too. But error message only indicates '#' after else clause. So we should remove the '#' characters. So the fixed code would be:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But '@' still weird. The instruction says "using ONLY the error message". The error message indicates only '#' issue. So we keep '@' and other logic same. The '#' after else clause are causing error. So remove them.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But is that valid syntax? It still may error due to '@' or missing parentheses. But instruction: only fix syntax error indicated by message. So we produce that.

We should output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
