Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We are told to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So there's an extra closing bracket after else clause. The snippet uses [ ] for blocks. Usually in many languages like JavaScript, C, etc, you use braces { } not brackets. But the code uses brackets [ ]. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause, because after the else clause there's a stray ]. The if clause has been closed already. So to fix: remove the final ] after else. Also maybe adjust brackets to proper syntax? But the instruction says only use the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error message points to stray ]. So the fixed code should be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

That removes the trailing ]. But also the else clause might need braces? But the error is about ']' after else clause. So removing it will resolve. So the output is the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

That's the final.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
