Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
It seems the '《' and '》' are used as brackets for the if body, but they incorrectly placed after else. The error says after else clause unexpected '》', meaning the else clause is not closed? Actually the '》' after else b = 2; maybe the outer '》' is not needed. So we should remove the last '》', and also close the 'if' body properly with '》' before else. The code likely should be:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
But also the 'else' part should be maybe also inside brackets? But they said use only symbols that appear in error message. The error message mentions '》' after else clause. So we should remove the trailing '》'. So final code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
But also the error message says 'if statement already closed', so maybe the else clause should be inside '》'? The else part maybe should be inside a block. But I think the minimal fix is to remove the trailing '》'. Also maybe need to close the if with '》', but we already have that. So final answer is the code with no trailing '》'.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
