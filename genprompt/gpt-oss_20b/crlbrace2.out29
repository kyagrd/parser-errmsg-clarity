Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code. The code has syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra `}` at the end. The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove that last `}`. Also need to make sure else clause syntax is correct. It might need braces around else? The error mentions else clause. But we can keep else b = 2; that's valid in some languages. However if it's a C-like language, the else clause can be just `else b = 2;`. That is fine. So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That should be correct. So output that inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
