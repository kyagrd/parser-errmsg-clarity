Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

So it's using brackets [ ] incorrectly. Should be braces { } for block or just single statements. In typical language like JavaScript or C-like, the syntax is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also remove stray closing bracket.

Thus corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or if single statements:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But given the original had semicolons inside [ ], we might keep the block. The simplest: replace [ ] with { } and remove trailing ]. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
