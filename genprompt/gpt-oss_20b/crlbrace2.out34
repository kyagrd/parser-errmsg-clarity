Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra closing brace. We need to remove the last '}'. Also need to add braces for else maybe. The error suggests else clause already closed. So we can write: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } That's typical. But "only the error message" means we only have "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". We should use symbols that appear in error message. The message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we must use '}' maybe. The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } We need to remove the final '}'. Also we might need to add braces after else: else { b = 2; } But braces already present? After else there is a space and b = 2; then semicolon; then closing brace. We need to wrap the else body in braces: else { b = 2; } So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } The extra '}' removed. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
