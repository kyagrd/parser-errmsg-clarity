Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. But we have to produce fixed code. The code currently is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an unmatched closing brace. Also else syntax: else statement without braces but a semicolon after the else body? Actually `else b = 2;` is allowed in many languages? In C or Java? In C, you need braces for else if not a single statement. `else b = 2;` is okay: else block with statement `b = 2;`. But there's an extra closing brace at the end. So we need to remove the trailing `}`. Also perhaps the if parentheses require semicolons. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` That's it. Output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
