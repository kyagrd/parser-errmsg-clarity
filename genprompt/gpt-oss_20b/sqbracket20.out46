Thinking...
We have a code snippet: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. There is a syntax error. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We only have error message: "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge, only the error message. That seems impossible. But we can interpret that the error message indicates a syntax error, so we need to fix the code accordingly. But the instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error". That doesn't contain symbols. So maybe we can't use symbols from the error message.

But we can still produce a fixed code. They want only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code likely uses parentheses and brackets incorrectly. It appears to be some C-like syntax but uses [ ] instead of { }.

Original: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. There is an extra closing bracket at the end. We can remove the extra bracket. Also maybe use braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But we cannot use { }? The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we could keep [ ].

Let's analyze: In typical languages, an if statement uses parentheses for condition and curly braces for block. They used [ ] for block. But the code has an unmatched closing bracket at the end. Also the else statement is missing brackets around its block. It uses `else b = 2;` which might be fine if it's a single statement.

But we have an extra ']' at the end. So we can remove the last ']' after else.

Thus code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That is syntactically correct if [ ] are allowed. But there's also a missing closing bracket for the else block? But else has no block, just a statement.

Maybe the syntax error is because of that stray ']' after the else. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`.

But maybe they want also to close the if block: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. But then we'd need to balance brackets. Let's count: Starting with `if (x > 0) [` -> open 1. Then `[ a = 1; ]` closes the if block. Good. Then `else b = 2; ]` closes nothing. So we can fix by removing the final `]`. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`.

Thus output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
