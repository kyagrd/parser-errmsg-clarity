Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses Chinese brackets 《 and 》 instead of curly braces or parentheses. In JavaScript? It looks like C-like syntax but using wrong brackets. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to replace 《 and 》 with curly braces { } or parentheses. The if has block a = 1; else b = 2; maybe we need braces around both. So correct:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the original code had an extra 》 at end: "else b = 2; 》" So we remove that closing bracket. Let's output fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
