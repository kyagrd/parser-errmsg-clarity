Thinking...
We have code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to fix syntax error using only error message (just says syntax error). But we can't use pre-trained knowledge? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should rely solely on the error message provided. But only "syntax error" doesn't tell details. However we can guess typical syntax error. But maybe we need to produce a fixed code that compiles in some language like Python or JavaScript or C? The original uses C-like syntax: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; # This seems to be maybe intended to be a conditional assignment: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But the code uses '@' and '#' incorrectly. So we need to correct. Likely language is JavaScript or C or C++? They used 'if (x > 0)' then '@ a = 1;' is not valid. They also used '# else b = 2; #', which is also invalid. So fix: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But might need braces: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But simple one-liner is okay. The question likely expects removing '@' and '#' and adding else. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
We output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
