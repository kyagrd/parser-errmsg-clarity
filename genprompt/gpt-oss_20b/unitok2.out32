Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. The error says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the code has a mismatched syntax: uses 《 and 》. Likely they should be parentheses or brackets? The error suggests that after else, there shouldn't be a '》'. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Probably the correct syntax is:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But we must use symbols that appear in error message: the symbols are '《' and '》'. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause, so we need to remove it after else. And maybe the closing bracket at end also wrong. So we can rewrite:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But need to remove the final '》'. Also maybe need to close the initial '《' before else? Actually the code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The first 《 opens block, 'a = 1;' then 》 closes. Then else b = 2; then 》 extra. So remove last 》.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the '》' after else is error. So remove that. Also maybe remove the last 》 at the very end. So final code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Thus output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
