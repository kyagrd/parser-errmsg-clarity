Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code given:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Issues: mismatched braces. else should have block or expression, but there is stray '}' at end. Likely need to remove the final '}'. Also if else needs braces around both? Not necessary. The code could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Better. The syntax error probably due to the stray closing brace. Provide fixed code. Use only error message? They say using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. Hmm we can't use pre-trained knowledge, but we can interpret error message "syntax error" and deduce fix. Ok.

We output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
