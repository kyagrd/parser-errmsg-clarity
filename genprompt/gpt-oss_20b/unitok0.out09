Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses some weird characters: 《 and 》 around statements. The error is syntax error. Likely should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should output the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We need to only use the error message, without pre-trained knowledge? Not relevant. Just output fixed code. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
