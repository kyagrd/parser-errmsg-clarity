Thinking...
We need to output the fixed code inside triple backticks. Code currently:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at the end. Also the else statement missing braces. Possibly need to add braces after else? The syntax likely similar to C-like. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to only output fixed code. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
