Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to replace '《' and '》' with appropriate braces. The error says 'unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)'. So the closing bracket after else is wrong. We need to close the if block before else. The correct syntax:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But the else must be else { b = 2; }? Actually else without braces can have single statement: else b = 2; But we need to close if block properly. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But the syntax of else with single statement requires no semicolon after the statement? The statement ends with semicolon. So it's okay.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we may want else { b = 2; } for clarity.

Probably use braces.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The original had only one pair of brackets around the if part. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the closing bracket '》' after else is wrong. Remove it. Also need to close the if block before else. So the answer: the fixed code block with braces.

Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
