Thinking...
We need to parse: The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". There's a stray # after else clause. Also syntax uses '@ a = 1;' which is odd; maybe it's supposed to be 'a = 1;'? In many languages like PHP, '@' is error suppression. But in Python, '@' denotes decorator, but not allowed there. Also if statement: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Maybe the intention: if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2. In many languages like C: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; So remove '#' and '@'.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But in C, need semicolons after statements. Already there. So final answer is just that. No commentary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
