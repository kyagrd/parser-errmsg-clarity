Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

The code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)"

It indicates that the unexpected character '》' is after else clause. The code uses some weird brackets. The syntax error indicates that the if statement already closed, but the '》' is still there. So we need to remove the '》' after else clause. Also need to close the if with '}'. The code appears to be using some kind of non-standard syntax. The fixed code presumably should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But maybe they just want to remove the stray '》' after else. The error says after else clause, if statement already closed. The stray '》' after else. So we should remove that. Also maybe the code originally uses brackets `《` and `》` but should be replaced with `{` and `}`. The problem says "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on external knowledge; but the error message suggests there's an unexpected '》' after else clause. So to fix we remove that stray '》'. The rest of code may still be wrong because we didn't close the if. But maybe we keep the syntax as is but remove that. So code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But that still uses 《 and 》. Are those valid in some language? Not standard. The error message only says '》' after else clause. So removing the last '》' should solve. The if statement is closed by the '》' after a = 1; That's the closing bracket. So the code would be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

We need to output only fixed code. I think the simplest is to remove that last stray '》'.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But that still has the 《. That might still be syntax error. However the error message didn't mention that. So maybe only remove the stray one.

Thus answer: triple backticks containing the code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
