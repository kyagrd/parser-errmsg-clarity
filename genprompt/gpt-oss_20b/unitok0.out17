Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The code has some weird brackets: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》 . We need to replace with proper syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

But instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can't rely on prior knowledge? We just have to use error message: syntax error. The code contains syntax error. We need to fix. Provide only fixed code in triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe they want semicolons after each statement? In many languages you might need to wrap in braces. So that's likely correct.

We output only the code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
