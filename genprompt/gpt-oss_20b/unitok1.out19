Thinking...
We have an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
It seems some weird characters '《' and '》' are used instead of curly braces or something. In typical C-like syntax, you would write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

So likely the fix is to replace 《 with { and 》 with }. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates that after else, we see 》, meaning a closing brace but there's no opening. So yes.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That is the answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
