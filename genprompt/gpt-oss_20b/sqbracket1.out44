Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). In languages like C or JavaScript, if syntax uses braces {}, not brackets []. Also extra closing bracket at end. We need to produce code with only the fixed syntax.

We must use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause; meaning that the ']' after else clause is erroneous. Also [ used incorrectly for code blocks.

The correct syntax for if statement: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But maybe we can also keep single statements. Without braces, we could write: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But there's an extra closing bracket at the end of line, causing error.

Also there is an opening bracket [ after condition, which is wrong. Should be { or nothing.

So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the code is missing semicolon after else block? The else block is just b = 2; which has semicolon. The whole line ends with semicolon after else block? In this example, we don't need closing bracket. So we can propose:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need to decide: maybe we want braces: 

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But that uses braces, but not necessarily needed.

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we should rely only on error message to correct. The error indicates extra closing bracket after else clause. We can remove it. Also the opening bracket after if is wrong. But maybe we could keep the brackets as they were: but we can just remove them. The code inside [ ] might be considered as part of the if block; but it's incorrect. So we need to change them to braces or remove them. The error message doesn't mention the opening bracket. But we can correct it by replacing brackets with braces. Use the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the fix: remove the closing bracket at the end. And remove the opening bracket after condition, or change it.

We output only fixed code inside triple backticks. Provide final code.

Let's provide with braces, as that's proper. But we must not use pre-trained knowledge; but the error message implies only the closing bracket is wrong, not the opening. But maybe the opening bracket is also wrong. But maybe we can leave it as [ ] but that would still be syntax error.

Thus the correct fix: remove brackets and use semicolons.

Thus code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we might want braces: but we can keep minimal.

I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
