Thinking...
We need to produce the fixed code, only inside triple backticks. The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the code uses unusual brackets: 《 and 》 presumably opening/closing statements. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. The error message says unexpected '》' after else clause, meaning the else clause is after the closing of the if statement. Probably the correct syntax should have the closing 》 after the else block? For example:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》

But they had else b = 2; 》 which has a closing 》 after the else statement. So we need to enclose else block in brackets too. So we replace "else b = 2; 》" with "else 《 b = 2; 》". And remove the final stray 》 at end. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But we still have a trailing 》? Let's count: "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》" The final 》 is closing the else block, not stray. That seems fine.

Thus output that.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
