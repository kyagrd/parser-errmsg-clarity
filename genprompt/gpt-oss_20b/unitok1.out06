Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

This uses wrong brackets: 《 and 》 instead of braces {}? In typical syntax, we need to replace 《 with { and 》 with }. Also ensure else block uses braces if needed. Provided else b=2; 》 has trailing 》 after else expression. So we need to remove trailing. Use proper syntax:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote. Provide the corrected code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
