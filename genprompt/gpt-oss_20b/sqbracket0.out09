Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in the code: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". It's maybe Python or C? They mention "use ONLY the error message" but error message is just "syntax error". So we can fix code. It looks like maybe they want correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } in C/C++/JavaScript. Also mismatched brackets: using [] instead of {} and trailing ]. So correct: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

They want only fixed code inside triple backquotes.

So answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
