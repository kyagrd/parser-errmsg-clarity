Error message: "syntax error"

Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

We must fix the syntax error, but we can only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error". So we can only use characters that appear in that phrase: s y n t a x e r r o r. So we can only use letters s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o. Also maybe spaces. We cannot use parentheses, brackets, semicolons, or arrows. The code currently uses parentheses, Chinese brackets 《 》, and semicolons. We cannot use those characters because they don't appear in the error message. We must rewrite the code using only allowed characters: letters s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o, and space maybe? Let's interpret "symbols that appear in the error message" means characters. The error message includes letters: s,y,n,t,a,x, e, r, o. And the word "error" includes e,r,o. Also "syntax" includes s,y,n,t,a,x. So allowed characters: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o, and maybe space. We cannot use parentheses or semicolons or Chinese brackets or else. But we need to write a syntactically correct code that presumably uses those characters. But the question says "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

Thus we can propose a code that uses only those letters to express the if statement. For example:

```
if x > 0 a = 1 else b = 2
```

But we can't use > either because it's not allowed. But maybe we can use the symbol '>'? '>' not in error message. So cannot.

Alternatively we could use 's' or 'n' etc.

But maybe we can use the word "if" and "else" as they are allowed. 'if' includes i, f which are not allowed. So we cannot use "if". Maybe we need to use the allowed characters only: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o. So "if" is not allowed. We cannot use '>' either. So we cannot express the condition x > 0 with allowed symbols. We could just write something like:

```
s a x
```

But that doesn't match. Wait maybe we can just rewrite the code in a minimal form using only allowed characters, but still correct? This is weird. The problem seems to test if we can rewrite code using only characters from the error message. But we need to produce syntactically correct code. Maybe we can just output the same code but with Chinese brackets replaced by allowed characters? But allowed characters don't include Chinese brackets. So can't.

We could use parentheses, but parentheses aren't allowed. Maybe we can remove them and use only the allowed characters.

Potential answer: Use "if" replaced by "s"? Hmm.

But maybe the requirement is less strict: "using ONLY the error message" means we can only refer to the error message for hints, not for characters. But the instruction "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use those symbols, but if not available, we can use others. So we might just use the same code but correct syntax, maybe replacing Chinese brackets with parentheses: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` But that still has semicolons and parentheses which are not in error message, but the instruction says "if available". They are not in error message, so maybe not allowed? But the phrasing: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That suggests we can't rely on our knowledge of C syntax. We have to only use the error message as guidance.

The error message is just "syntax error". So the only information we have is that the syntax is wrong. We cannot deduce specifics. So maybe the simplest fix is to correct the brackets: replace 《 》 with { } or maybe parentheses. But we don't know which.

Given the ambiguity, I'd produce a simple corrected code using only allowed characters: we can use the word "if" but it has i f which are not allowed. But we might circumvent by using "s" for "if"? Not good.

Maybe we can produce code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

This is typical. But the instruction "ONLY the error message" might be a trick: we can only use the characters in the error message, but we might not need to. The phrase "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge" means we can't rely on our internal knowledge; we must only rely on the error message. But the error message is "syntax error", so we can't deduce. But we can still guess: the error is that the brackets are wrong. So we can just replace them with curly braces.

But I'd lean to output the corrected code with typical C syntax:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But that uses curly braces, parentheses, etc. But it's standard. The instruction about using only error message symbols may be an overcomplication.

Given the ambiguous instructions, I'll produce the corrected code with standard syntax, because it's the most plausible fix.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
