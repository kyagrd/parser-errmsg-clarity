Thinking...
We have a code snippet: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So there's a stray `#` after else clause. The code appears to be pseudo-language. We need to fix syntax using only symbols that appear in error message. The error message mentions "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we should remove the stray '#'. Also the code has `@` after the condition. Possibly wrong. But the instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only have error message to base. So we will remove the # after else. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. The stray # removed. But we might still have error due to `@`. But not mentioned in error. So keep it. Also maybe need to close parentheses. Already closed. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. Provide inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
