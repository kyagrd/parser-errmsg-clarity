Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error: syntax error. They want us to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote. So we need to fix the syntax error. The code seems like a C-style if statement but has `@` and `#` which are not valid. It probably is from a language like Ruby or Python? But `if (x > 0)` suggests C/C++/Java. In C, you can't have `@` or `#` inside. Maybe the intended code is: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Remove `@` and `#`. Or maybe they want to keep the comment characters? In C, `#` is preprocessor directive; cannot be inside a statement. So remove them. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Also maybe add braces? But not necessary. So output that code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
