Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see mismatch braces. There is an extra '}' at end. Also else statement missing braces around 'b = 2'. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also we need to remove stray '}'.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return only that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
