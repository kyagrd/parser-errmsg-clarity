Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We have mismatched brackets. Use braces for if/else. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also there is an extra ']' at end. So final code. Output only fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
