Thinking...
We need to produce only fixed code. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace. Also else needs block? In given syntax, maybe else b = 2; is allowed but the closing brace after that is extra. So remove last '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
