Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
They mention syntax of code may be different from existing languages. Need to use symbols that appear in error message. The error message indicates unexpected '#' after else clause, because if statement already closed. So there's a '#' after else b = 2; #, maybe the code has extra '#'. We need to remove or reposition '#'. In the code, they used '@' maybe syntax to separate? The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. Probably the language expects "if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;" with maybe '@' as separator? The '#' maybe comment marker? But the error message suggests '#' after else clause is unexpected. So remove trailing '#' after else clause. Also maybe the '#' before else is wrong. Could use 'else' but '#' used to separate else? Actually code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. So maybe syntax uses '@' to denote 'then', '#' to denote else? But the error indicates that '#' after else clause is wrong. So need to remove that trailing '#'. Also maybe the '#' before else is okay as delimiter? Might need to keep it. Let's propose: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;. That seems correct.

But the problem says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to adjust the code to not have that trailing '#'. Also maybe need to remove the '#' before else? But the error mentions after else clause, not before. So just remove the trailing '#'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

But we might need to close the if properly. The language might require a closing 'end' or something? But not given. They ask to output only fixed code. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
