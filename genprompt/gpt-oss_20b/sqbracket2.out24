Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to fix by removing the unexpected ']' at the end, or correct syntax. The instruction: use only error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. Use symbols that appear in error message. The error message says 'unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)'. So remove the last ']' after else clause. Probably also need correct braces? But we only remove last bracket.

Original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Remove last bracket: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
That seems to be the fixed code. No need to modify else part. Output code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
