Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

We have error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix the syntax error. Let's analyze the code.

They use [ and ] for blocks instead of braces {}. That's presumably wrong. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause, meaning there's a stray ']' after else. They have two ']' at the end: one after a = 1; and one after b = 2;. Also there is no else block bracket.

We should replace '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'. But maybe the code expects to use brackets? However typical languages use braces. Also the error says else clause already closed. So we need to close the if statement properly.

Also the else clause is missing braces. The correct code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check if there's any trailing stray bracket? No.

Thus output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
