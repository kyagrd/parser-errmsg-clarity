Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote. Code currently:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies that the else clause is present incorrectly? The code shows an 'else' inside a comment? Actually there is "# else b = 2; #". There's a # before else and after. It's commented out? The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe the syntax is that after else there's a '#', but the if statement was already closed. So we need to remove the stray '#', maybe the code should be:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we don't know what @ means. But the instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only see that error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we can fix by removing the stray '#' after else clause and before the end. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Also remove the '#' before else? The code currently has '# else b = 2; #' where there are two #. The error indicates unexpected '#' after else clause, so we need to remove the '#' after else clause. The '#' before else is part of comment? But maybe it's considered part of code. The error indicates after else clause, if statement already closed. So maybe after 'else' there should be code, not '#'. So the '#' after else is causing error. So we keep the '#' before else? That might also cause an issue but maybe not. The error specifically says unexpected '#' after else clause. So we remove the '#' after else, leaving '# else b = 2;'? That still has a '#' before else. Might still be okay? But to be safe, maybe we remove both '#' and keep else. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Yes. Output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
