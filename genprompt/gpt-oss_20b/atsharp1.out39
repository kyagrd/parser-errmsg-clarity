Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to use only the error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the issue: There is a '#' comment after else clause but the else clause is missing? Actually "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)" indicates that the parser found '#' after the else clause, but the if statement is already closed. So we need to correct it.

We have "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" This seems weird: "@" maybe used to assign? Should be "if (x > 0) a = 1;" And else part: "# else b = 2; #". The '#' characters are comment markers. In many languages like JavaScript, comments start with '//' or '/*', not '#'. In Python, '#' is comment. But the code seems to use '@' which is not typical. Could be a placeholder for "then". The error indicates else clause after if closed. The code: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" There is no else clause; just comment. So the '#' after else indicates that the else clause was omitted but comment incorrectly used.

So the fix: remove stray '#' and restructure if-else properly.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

We can propose:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```
But the error was "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The else clause is not present; comment has 'else'. So we should remove that comment. So final code: maybe:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```
But maybe we want to keep else? Not necessary.

Better to keep if-else but remove '#'.

Thus final fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```
But we need to use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we still produce the fixed code. So output triple backticks.

Ok.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```
