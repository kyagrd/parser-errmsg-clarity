Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to fix using only the error message. The message indicates unexpected ']' after else clause, if already closed. So we remove the last ']'. Also the syntax uses square brackets for blocks? Probably it's like if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]? But they used else b = 2; ]. Maybe just remove the last bracket: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` That ends with semicolon. That may compile in this syntax. They want only use symbols that appear in error message. The error message has ']' and else. So we keep else. We fix by removing last ]. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Check that no stray brackets. The if block uses [ ]. Good. The else block no brackets but that's fine. So output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
