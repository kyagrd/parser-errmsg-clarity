Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, no pre-trained knowledge? It's a creative constraint: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we should rely on error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That indicates the code has something like if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause, because the else clause is commented incorrectly. We need to fix syntax. The code uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The syntax is wrong: should be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } . But maybe the goal is to remove comments or correct structure. Use error message: we need to close if statement before else, and remove '#'.

So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But that still may be incorrect syntax in some languages. The original uses `@` maybe an operator? Or it's a comment? The syntax looks like a pseudo-code.

Better: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Thus we produce fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

That solves the error. Use only error message: we just removed '#', and closed if before else. So output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
