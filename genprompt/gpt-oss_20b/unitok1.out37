Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in the code. The code uses Chinese-style brackets 《 》. The if statement is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

We need to convert to proper syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). We need to use the error message only to derive fix? They say using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. So from error message we know that after else clause there's an unexpected '》', because if statement is already closed. So we need to remove the extra '》'. Also maybe use proper braces.

But they say "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we need to output fixed code. We have to output code in triple backticks. Provide only the fixed code.

Thus final answer: code with braces.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check if extra '》' removed. Yes. Use curly braces. That is correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
