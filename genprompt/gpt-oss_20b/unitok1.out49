Thinking...
We have error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters. It seems like a syntax where they used some kind of custom markers. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They put `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》` then else b = 2; then close with 》? The error: unexpected '》' after else clause. So the final 》 is extraneous. We should remove it. Also the else part should be inside delimiters? It seems if statement closed before else, so the else should be separate. But we don't need to use delimiters? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we need to produce fixed code. Use only the error message to infer fix: Remove the last 》. Also maybe need to use parentheses around else? The code likely expects something like:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies that after else, there shouldn't be a closing 》? Wait: if statement already closed, meaning the '》' after a = 1; closed the if block. Then else b = 2; is after that, but the language still expects no '》' after else. So the code should be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

So just remove trailing 》. That likely correct.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
