Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY error message "syntax error". Can't use prior knowledge. But we need to produce corrected code. We don't know language; code uses parentheses, @ symbol, semicolons, comments. The syntax error likely due to "@" after condition. Perhaps correct is "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }". Use braces. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
