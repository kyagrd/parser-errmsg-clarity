Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There's an error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe the language is a shell or something. The error indicates '#' comment symbol after else clause? Actually the code uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. It seems the code intends to have if-else. But syntax is wrong. They used `@` after condition? Not sure.

Maybe language is "PowerShell" or "Shell"? But error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The '#' is comment char. After else clause, the `#` appears. Actually there is `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. In many languages, the if syntax is: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The given code uses semicolons and `#` comment. The error indicates that else clause was already closed but a comment symbol `#` appears after else clause? Wait: maybe the code is in C++? No, C++ uses `//` comment. `#` not recognized.

Maybe it's a language that uses `@` for variable assignment? Not sure.

But the error says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means the parser encountered a `#` after the else clause was closed, so the `#` is considered a token, not a comment. So maybe the language uses `#` for some token? But if it's a shell script, `if [ condition ]; then a=1; else b=2; fi`. There is no `@` or semicolons like that. And '#' in shell is comment, but after else clause? The else clause is ended by `fi`. If there is a `#` after that, it's fine. So the error seems from a language like "Ruby" where `#` is comment. In Ruby, you cannot have `#` after the else clause, but you can comment after else? Example: `if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2 end`. Then you could have `# comment`. So no error.

Wait the error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)" This might be from a templating engine like Jinja? Or maybe from the 'bash' 'sh' interpreter?

But the code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. This looks like maybe they attempted to write 'if' statement in some unknown language but used `@` incorrectly.

Maybe the actual intention: It's a 'C' style if, but with `@` before assignment? Perhaps `@` is a macro for assignment. Not typical.

We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. So we only rely on error message: Unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove the `#` after else clause. The else clause is already closed, so the '#' should not be there.

Thus we need to adjust code so that there is no '#' after else clause. The code might be: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;` or something. But we need to include the code inside triple backticks. Provide fixed code.

So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`.

But maybe the `#` was meant to comment out the else clause? No. We just remove them.

Thus final answer: triple backticks with code.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe the language expects braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But error message only about '#' after else clause. So we might just remove '#' and keep rest unchanged.

So answer: the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
