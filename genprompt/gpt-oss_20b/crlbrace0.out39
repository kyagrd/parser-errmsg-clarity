Thinking...
We have code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There is a syntax error due to extra closing brace. Also else should be with braces. Proper syntax: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
No extraneous } at end. Also the else statement: else b = 2; is fine syntactically but best practice is braces. However the error is due to extra }. The code probably is in JavaScript/C-like syntax. So we remove the last }.

Thus fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But maybe they want braces for else: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Either works. But the original had a stray }. The simplest fix: remove that trailing brace. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
