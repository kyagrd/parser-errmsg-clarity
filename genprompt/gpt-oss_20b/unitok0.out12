Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block."

We have a code snippet that seems to be a conditional statement in some language (maybe JavaScript or similar) but uses weird brackets: 《 and 》. This is not a valid syntax. We need to fix the syntax error. The user wants us to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. And we should use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But the error message is simply "syntax error." So we need to produce a corrected version. The simplest fix is to replace 《 and 》 with curly braces {}. So the fixed code would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, we could just use proper syntax: 
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But we should output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. Let's do that.

We have to ensure that we don't add any explanation. Just output the code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
