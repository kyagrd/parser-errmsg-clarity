Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We must remove the stray closing brace. Also, syntax: else should be followed by a block or statement. The current code else b = 2; is fine but must be inside braces? Actually else statement can be a single statement: else b = 2; is fine. But we need to close the if statement? The stray } at the end is extra. So fix: remove the last }.

Thus final code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But also could add braces around else block: else { b = 2; } to make consistent. But not necessary. The requirement: fix syntax error using only error message. The error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove that '}'. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
Return only that code inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
