Thinking...
We need to produce only the fixed code in triple backquotes. The syntax error is because of using Chinese angle brackets '《' '》' instead of braces or parentheses. The code currently: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Likely they want: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. They mention "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should only rely on the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The error indicates the parser encountered a '》' after else clause. So we should remove '》' and use correct braces. The error message indicates that the else clause already closed due to the '》'. So we need to close the if block before else. So final code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes. Output only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
