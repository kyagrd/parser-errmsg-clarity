Thinking...
We need to output fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have syntax error. The only symbols that appear in error message? The error message is just "syntax error". The instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only has the word "syntax error". No symbols. But we can use symbols that appear in the error message. There are none except whitespace. So maybe we cannot use special symbols? But we must fix syntax. We can change the code to a syntax that matches a plausible language. The original code uses if with parentheses, then `@ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Maybe the intended syntax is something like:

`if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`

But we must not use any symbol that didn't appear in error message? The only symbols we can use: space and maybe letters? But we can use curly braces which are not in the error message. The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." This is confusing. Perhaps the trick is: the error message "syntax error" contains the word "syntax". The symbols that appear in it are the letters 's','y','n','t','a','x','e','r','o','r'? But those are letters. Maybe we can only use those letters? But we need to produce fixed code. It's ambiguous.

Could be a trick: The code as given has syntax errors: the '@' and '#' are not valid. So we need to remove them. A minimal fix: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That removes `@` and `#`. That is probably acceptable. The syntax would be if statement with no block. But some languages allow that. So output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wrap in triple backticks. That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
