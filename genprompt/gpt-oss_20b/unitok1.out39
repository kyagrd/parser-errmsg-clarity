Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses non-ASCII brackets. We need to replace them with correct braces or parentheses.

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Probably intended:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Thus output only the fixed code in triple backticks. No explanation.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
