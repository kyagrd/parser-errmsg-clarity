Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

We need to fix: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)"

The code has an extra closing brace at the end. Also else clause missing braces. The corrected code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

We output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Double-check syntax: if condition with braces, else with braces. All balanced. Good.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Let's produce final.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
