Thinking...
The task: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we need to fix code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there is a `#` comment character after else? Actually the code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. They used `@` instead of colon? Many languages use `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` maybe they want to assign? In some languages like Ruby or PHP? The code shows "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests that after the `if`, the `else` clause should be part of the same statement but they've inserted a comment starting with `#` after the if block, causing parser to think else part has started? Wait: In many languages like Python, comments start with `#`. But the code is not Python; it uses parentheses for condition, semicolons, and `@`. It might be a language like JavaScript? But comments there are `//` or `/* */`. The error message mentions "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)", so maybe it's a language that uses `#` for comments, but the parser expects something else? Could be R? But R uses `if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else { b = 2 }`. Not like this.

But they used `# else b = 2; #`. So maybe the code is in a language like C++ where `#` is preprocessor directive. The error is that the `else` part is being interpreted incorrectly due to the comment `#`. In C++ a preprocessor directive starting with `#` is processed before compilation. So after the semicolon `; # else b = 2; #`, the preprocessor sees `# else b = 2; #`. This is not a valid preprocessor directive and causes syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause. Actually, the error says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the preprocessor or compiler sees `else b = 2;` as part of the if statement? Not sure.

But the key is: to fix syntax error, remove the comment markers (#) or use proper comment syntax. Since we must use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message says the '#' after else clause is unexpected. So we need to remove the '#' after else clause or comment properly. Also we have a stray `@` in if block. That may also cause error. But the error message didn't mention '@', but maybe it's also wrong. But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only fix the syntax error indicated by the error message: unexpected '#' after else clause. So we remove '#' from else clause. Also maybe we need to close the if block properly. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The else part is commented incorrectly. We should write: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the '@' still there. In many languages, assignment is `=`, but the `@` maybe an annotation? But we keep as is because not mentioned by error.

But better to remove '#' from else and after else. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That resolves unexpected '#'. But maybe we also need to add braces for clarity. But not necessary.

Thus answer: output only the fixed code inside triple backquote.

Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Check: That uses no '#' at all. That should fix syntax error.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
