Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Original: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to correct brackets and syntax. Likely intended:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But note they had an extra `]` at end. Also brackets should be `{}` not `[]`. Also else part missing braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output only that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
