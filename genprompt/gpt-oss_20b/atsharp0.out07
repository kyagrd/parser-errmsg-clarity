Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, using only the error message (just "syntax error")? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can only rely on the error message. But we still need to produce corrected code. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This looks like a C or Java style code. Syntax error might be due to "@" symbol after the condition, or using # as comments (C uses // or /* */). The "@" is invalid. Also else part commented out incorrectly.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So we need to provide corrected code. But we can't use pre-trained knowledge. However we can still reason logically. The simplest corrected code would be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But we might also keep # comments but they are not valid in C. Could be JavaScript where # is not comment. # used in Python for comment. But syntax with parentheses suggests C-like. So using braces.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
