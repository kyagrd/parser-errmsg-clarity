Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` There's an else clause? Actually the code has a hash symbol (#) after the if block, but no else. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe we need to remove the '#' after else. The code is `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There's no else. The syntax likely expects `else` before `# else b = 2; #`. But the comment seems wrong. We need to keep it? Use only error message symbols: '#' and 'else' maybe. Let's replace `# else b = 2; #` with `else b = 2;`. But the initial code has `@ a = 1;`. The symbol `@` might be wrong. But error message only complains about '#'. The code may be custom language. So just remove the '#' characters. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems correct. So output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
