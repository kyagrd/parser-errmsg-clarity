Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. There's an extra bracket at end. Should be `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Or maybe brackets replaced with parentheses? But we should use symbols in error message. The error message: "syntax error". There's no specific symbols. But they said use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message is just text, no symbols. So we can just fix the code logically.

The code seems to use `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Extra `]` at end. Also else clause missing brackets. Might need to add `[` before `b = 2;`. So correct code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. We output only the fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
