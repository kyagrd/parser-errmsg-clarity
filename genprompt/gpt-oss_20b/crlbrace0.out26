Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Error: syntax error. The error likely due to mismatched braces. There is an extra closing brace at the end. Also missing braces around else block? The else clause currently is `else b = 2;` which is fine without braces if single statement. But the final `}` is extraneous. So remove the final `}`. The corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Check: The code may also require braces for else: `else { b = 2; }`. But the error was syntax due to unmatched braces. Removing the last } fixes it.

Thus final output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
