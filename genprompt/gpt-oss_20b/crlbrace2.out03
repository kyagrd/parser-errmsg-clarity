Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra closing brace after the else. Also the else clause syntax missing braces: should be `{ b = 2; }`. But can also be just `else b = 2;` without braces, but the code has an extra '}'. So we need to remove that. Also the if statement already closed after `}` after `b = 2;`? Actually the else part is `b = 2;` then there's a `}` after. So the fixed code: remove the last `}`. Also the else should have braces? The error message only complains about unexpected '}'. We can just remove that. The code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This seems syntactically fine. But the else clause might need braces depending on language. But the instruction: Use only error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we can still guess. Use only symbols that appear in error message: '}' and maybe 'if', 'else', 'unexpected'. But we can just remove the '}'. The instruction: Use only the error message. So we can produce fixed code by removing the closing brace. So output the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That is the answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
