Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]"

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. They mention using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But as ChatGPT, I still have pre-trained knowledge. However we can treat the error message indicates syntax error. So we need to produce fixed code. Let's parse the code: It's an if statement in C-like syntax but with square brackets instead of braces. Also missing semicolon after else? Actually it's "else b = 2; ]". Also extra closing bracket at the end. So correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

So output inside triple backticks. That's it.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
