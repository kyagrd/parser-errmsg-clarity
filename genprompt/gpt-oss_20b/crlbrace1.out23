Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error in the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)

So the error is that there is an extra closing brace `}` after the else statement. The else clause should be a statement, not a block? Actually else b = 2; is fine without braces, but there's an extra } at the end. So remove the extra }.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's it. No extra braces. Output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
