Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra `}` at the end. So we remove that. Also the else clause syntax: else { b = 2; } or else b = 2; is allowed in C-like languages, but typically need braces? In many languages else without braces is okay: `else b = 2;` is valid. But the error suggests that the if statement already closed: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. After `else b = 2;` there is a stray `}`. So fix by removing the last `}`.

Thus the corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That's likely the fixed code. The user says "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's provide that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
