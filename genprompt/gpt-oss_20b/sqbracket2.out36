Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So likely syntax is something like: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]? The extra closing bracket at end. The code shows after else b = 2; ] there's an unmatched ]. So we need to remove the stray ']' at end. The else clause already closed? The error says if statement already closed. So maybe the syntax uses brackets for blocks. The code currently: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

We need to fix: maybe it's: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ] ; But the error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies that after else clause, there's a ']' that is not expected. The else clause has no brackets, just "b = 2;". Then there's an extra ']' after it. So to fix, remove that ']' and maybe add an opening '[' after else to match style. But the error message says "if statement already closed", meaning that the if block is closed by ']' after a=1. So else clause should start with a block? But in code, else b = 2; no bracket. Then ']' after else is unexpected.

Thus to fix, we can remove the stray ']' after else. So code becomes: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But maybe we also need to close the else block? But else block not using brackets. But error message about ']' suggests we need to remove the last bracket. So final code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

Return that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
