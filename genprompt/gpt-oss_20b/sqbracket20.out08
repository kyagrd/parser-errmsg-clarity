Thinking...
We need to output the fixed code. The code has syntax error. Provided error message: "syntax error". We can't use pre-trained knowledge? We can only use the error message? It says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we have to rely on the error message "syntax error" only. But we can still infer something. We need to fix code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The syntax errors: mismatched brackets, missing parentheses, etc. We can fix by changing brackets to parentheses, and ensure braces. Use `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But we must only use symbols that appear in the error message "syntax error". The error message only contains the words 'syntax' and 'error', no symbols. So maybe we cannot use any symbols that are not present in the error message? That seems odd. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message doesn't have any symbols like `[` or `]` or `{` or `}`. It only has text. But maybe the answer should use the same symbols as before: we can keep the brackets but fix mismatched bracket at end. The error message only has "syntax error". There's no symbol like `]` or `[`. But we can still produce a corrected version: remove the last `]` and maybe adjust. The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. If we just remove the last `]`, we get: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. This might still be syntax error because using `[` and `]` as block delimiters? Not sure. The instruction says "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So maybe the original syntax used square brackets for block statements? Then the only syntax error might be the stray `]` at the end. So the fixed code would be: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That uses only symbols present: parentheses, square brackets, semicolons, equals, else, etc. The error message doesn't contain these though. But the instruction "using ONLY the error message" seems contradictory. But maybe they just mean use only the error message as guidance? But we can output the fixed code anyway.

Let's provide the corrected code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`.

But we need to output inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
