Thinking...
We have an error: "syntax error". Code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Observations: The if statement is missing parentheses? In many languages like C, Java, etc, syntax: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }. The code has else b = 2; which is missing braces. Also there's an extra closing brace at end. So correct: remove the last } or add braces to else. But easiest: remove extra } at end. Also else b = 2; could be acceptable in some languages? In C, else must be followed by statement, but that statement can be assignment. So else b = 2; is valid. But the missing braces around the if block? Actually if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; This is valid in C? I think yes, else must be followed by a statement; assignment is a statement. So only error is unmatched brace. So remove the last }.

Thus fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
We should provide code only. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
