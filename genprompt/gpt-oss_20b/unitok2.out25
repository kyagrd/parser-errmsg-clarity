Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error. The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code uses custom syntax with 《 and 》 to enclose block? The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems the else clause has an unmatched 》 after else. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause because the if statement already closed. So we need to remove the stray 》 after else. Also maybe close the if block correctly. The else statement currently is "else b = 2; 》" where 》 is closing something. But after else there should not be closing. So remove that 》.

But also the if block uses 《 a = 1; 》. That looks okay. After else, we should not have an extra closing symbol. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But check: There's a trailing 》 at the end of entire statement. That might be stray. The original had `else b = 2; 》`. So we remove the last 》.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to also close the if statement? In this syntax, the if block uses 《 and 》. The else part might also need a closing? But error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So yes we remove that 》. So final output is that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
