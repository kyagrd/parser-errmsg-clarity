Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We must use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That indicates a stray ']' after else clause. The correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

Probably they want minimal changes: replace '[' with '{', remove stray ']'.

Thus output only fixed code inside triple backticks.

Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check: if statement closed. No stray bracket. Good.

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
