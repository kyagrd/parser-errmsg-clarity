Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY error message, not pre-trained knowledge. Error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We see there's an extra ']' at the end. Also syntax seems to use brackets for block? We can replace with matching brackets.

We can remove the last ']':

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe need to close else block with ']'? If using brackets for both if and else? The pattern: if condition [ ... ] else ...; The else part might need brackets? But code uses `else b = 2;`. That is okay? Might require brackets too? But the error says after else clause (if statement already closed). That means after else, there is a ']' when if block already closed. So remove that. Also maybe missing closing ']' for else? But else is not bracketed. Perhaps syntax requires else block in brackets too: else [ b = 2; ]? The code has else b = 2; but that's fine maybe. We'll simply remove last bracket.

Thus output fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 
```
