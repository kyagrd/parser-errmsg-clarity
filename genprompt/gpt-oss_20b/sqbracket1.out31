Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error based on error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The syntax error: after else clause there's an unexpected ']' because the if statement already closed. The issue: using brackets [ ] instead of braces { } or parentheses for blocks? In many languages like C, C++, Java, etc, the syntax is if (condition) { block } else { block }. The code uses [ ] incorrectly, plus extra closing ] after else. Also missing braces for else block? So we need to correct to proper syntax: remove brackets, replace with braces. Also remove extra ]. So correct code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is confusing: we have to only use error message? But we are allowed to produce corrected code. The error message indicates there's an unexpected ']' after else clause, because the if statement is already closed. So we need to close properly. So correct code likely:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must output only fixed code inside triple backquote. So final answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check if else block has braces: yes. Remove extra ']' after else. So output.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
