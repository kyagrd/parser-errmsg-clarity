Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There is an extra closing brace at end. Also else missing braces. So we need to correct: remove the last '}'. Possibly change else to have braces: else { b = 2; }. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That matches. Let's output code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
