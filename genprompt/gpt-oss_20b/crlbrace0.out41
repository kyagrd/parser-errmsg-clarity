Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

They want us to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So we need to correct the code.

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We see an extra closing brace at the end. Also the else clause needs braces or should be `else { b = 2; }`. But simplest fix: remove the trailing `}` or add an opening `{`. But the error likely due to unmatched braces. Remove the trailing `}`. So corrected:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
Alternatively, add braces: `else { b = 2; }`. Both are valid. But the error is syntax due to unmatched brace. So remove the last `}`. Provide code.

User says: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So we just output code.

Thus:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we need to include triple backticks.

Thus final answer: triple backticks with code.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
