Thinking...
We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquote. The original code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace at end: there's one opening brace after if (x > 0) { ... } else b = 2; } . There is opening brace after if, closed after a = 1. There's no opening brace for else. There is extra closing brace at the end. Should remove that final brace. Also perhaps else part missing braces? But maybe we can keep as simple: else b = 2; . So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; . No extra closing brace.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
