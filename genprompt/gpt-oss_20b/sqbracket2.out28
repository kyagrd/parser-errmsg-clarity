Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to produce fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We need to fix the syntax by removing the stray ']' after else clause. Also perhaps mismatched brackets: The 'if' has opening parenthesis, then [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The closing ']' after else is unexpected. So we should remove the last ']' maybe. The 'if' uses [ ] brackets to enclose statements. That seems odd but allowed. So we can keep [ ] after if, but remove the trailing ]. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. But maybe need semicolon after else? It's `else b = 2;` okay.

So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Wrap inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
