Thinking...
We need to output fixed code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we have an else after else comment but the if statement already closed? It seems the code uses '@' maybe as some kind of syntax? We need to fix syntax using symbols in error message? They say use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message includes: 'unexpected', '#', 'after', 'else', 'clause', 'if', 'already', 'closed'.

We need to fix code. The code currently: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #.

It seems that after the 'if' there's '@ a = 1;' maybe the '@' is a syntax error. We might need to replace '@' with some symbol. Maybe the correct syntax is 'then', but not in list. We can maybe remove '@' and put a space. Also need to handle the else part. Maybe we need to close the if before else. The '#' comments after else? It seems comment after else causing error because else clause already closed. Maybe the '#' marks comment but it's after else, but the else clause is closed earlier. So we need to remove '#' or reposition it. We can place the comment after the else statement. The code might be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need to keep '#' symbols maybe. They ask to use symbols that appear in error message, if available. '#' appears in error message. We could keep '#' as comment markers but not cause error. In many languages '#' starts comment until end of line. But if we use '#' after else but before else clause, maybe it's okay if comment after else but before statement? They have '# else b = 2; #' which is comment around else? Hard.

The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means the parser thinks the else clause is closed before '#', but '#' is after else clause. The else clause is 'else b = 2; #', but parser didn't expect '#' after else clause. So maybe the '#' after else is considered part of the code incorrectly. We can move '#' before else. Like comment the else part? Or just remove '#'.

But we need to use '#' symbol? They said use symbols that appear in error message, if available. But not mandatory. They didn't require '#' to be used. They just suggest to use symbols that appear in error message. It might be optional.

Simplest fix: remove '#' comments and '@' maybe. Code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe '@' is a special token indicating 'then'? But we can just remove '@' and have 'if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;' which should compile if syntax supports that.

Thus output that code. Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
