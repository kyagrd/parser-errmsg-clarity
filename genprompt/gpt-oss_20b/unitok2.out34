Thinking...
We need to output the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code originally: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
There is an error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The syntax of the code may be different from existing languages. They use 《 and 》 as delimiters? The code probably uses 《 ... 》 to denote a block. The error message says unexpected '》' after else clause. So we need to adjust syntax. Probably the correct syntax: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
Thus closing the else block with 》. So missing opening 《 for else. Also there might be an extra 》 at end. The original has three 》: after a = 1; 》 then after else b = 2; 》. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates that else clause already had a block closed? So we need to have 《 after else. So output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

We don't need to add an extra 》 after whole code. So output this.
...done thinking.
