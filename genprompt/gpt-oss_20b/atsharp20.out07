Thinking...
We have error: syntax error. The code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
It appears maybe a language where @ is invalid token? We need to fix syntax using only symbols that appear in error message. The error message is just "syntax error". So we can't use pre-trained knowledge, but we need to fix error. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

We need to produce code that presumably compiles or interprets. Since we don't know the language, we need to guess a minimal fix: maybe remove the @ and #. Possibly the language expects if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }? But no braces. But the snippet had '@' before 'a', maybe that's a macro or annotation? The syntax error might be due to the '@' and '#' tokens. The simplest fix: replace '@' with ':'? Or remove them. But we have to use only symbols that appear in the error message? The error message only says "syntax error" - which includes letters and space. But we can't use pre-trained knowledge, but we can use only the error message? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use characters from "syntax error": that includes letters s y n a t c e r o f, space, maybe punctuation? Actually "syntax error" contains letters: s y n a t x e r o f? Wait, "syntax error" contains letters s,y,n,a,t,x,e,r,o,f? Let's check: "syntax error" => s y n a t x e r o f? Actually "syntax" letters: s, y, n, a, t, x. Then space. "error" letters: e, r, r, o, r. Combined set: {s,y,n,a,t,x,e,r,o}. Also space.

So we can only use these characters. That means we can only use letters s,y,n,a,t,x,e,r,o and space. No digits? No parentheses? But the code currently uses parentheses. But maybe we can change parentheses to something else? But we cannot use parentheses because not in allowed characters. However, we don't need to remove parentheses maybe they are allowed? The instruction says "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That might mean if we need to add a symbol not present, we can't. But we can keep parentheses because they already exist. We just need to change the problematic '@' and '#'.

We can replace '@' with something from allowed set. For example, maybe 's' or 'y' etc. But '@' is not allowed. So remove it or replace with 'a'? But 'a' is allowed. So we can write "if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #" The '#' may still cause error. Replace '#' with 's' maybe? But '#' isn't allowed. So remove '#' or replace with space or allowed letter. So we can remove '# else b = 2; #' or replace with 'else b = 2;'. The else keyword is allowed: letters e,l,s,e? Wait 'l' is not allowed. So can't use 'else'. The error message does not contain 'l', so we cannot use 'else'. But maybe the language doesn't need 'else' and uses something else? The original code had '# else b = 2; #', maybe a comment syntax '# ... #'? Actually the snippet: "# else b = 2; #" maybe it's a comment: start '#' and end '#', like some languages like Perl or Ruby use '#', but usually single '#', not start and end '#'. But the snippet may use '# ... #' to comment out. So maybe the syntax error is due to the '#' comments being invalid. We can just remove them entirely. So final code: if (x > 0) a = 1;

But we need else part? Not necessary maybe.

We can produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```

But we removed else part. That may be acceptable. But maybe the code expects else branch, but not necessary.

We have to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```

But is 'x' allowed? 'x' is allowed. '>' not allowed? The error message didn't contain '>' but we can keep it as it's already present. The code originally had 'x > 0', so it's fine.

Thus final answer: 

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```

But the question: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We can't use pre-trained knowledge, but we can still produce the code. But maybe we need to preserve structure: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; but else uses 'e', 'l', 's', 'e', but 'l' not allowed. We can't use 'l'. So maybe we can't use else. So final code just one branch.

Thus answer: triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```
