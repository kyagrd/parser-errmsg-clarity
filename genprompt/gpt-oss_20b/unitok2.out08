Thinking...
We have an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. That means we can't refer to standard syntax like braces or semicolons, but can use symbols that appear in error message, such as '》', '《', maybe 'else', 'if', etc. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the '》' after else is wrong. We need to remove that. So maybe code should be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But also the last '》' after the semicolon maybe still present? The code currently has: "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". The last '》' after the semicolon may also be problematic. We could remove it. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
Also perhaps remove the '》' before the 'else'? That one is correct, closing the if block. Then the else clause is "b = 2;". Should we keep the trailing semicolon? Probably yes. So final code: inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
