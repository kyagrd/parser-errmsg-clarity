Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The syntax error likely due to `@` and `#`. The question: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot rely on knowledge of languages? But we can use symbols that appear in the error message: syntax error. But we can't output anything else. Just code.

We need to output the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We need to replace `@` with `:` maybe? Or use standard syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But we need to use only symbols that appear in the error message? The error message: "syntax error". The symbols appear: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o, d? Actually the string "syntax error" has letters. So we could use only these letters? That seems weird. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message: "syntax error". So symbols: s, y, n, t, a, x, space, e, r, o. The code uses parentheses, semicolons, etc. We can use parentheses and semicolons? Those symbols don't appear in the error message. But we might not need them? The code could be: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But semicolons, parentheses, etc. Not in error message. But the instruction says: try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. But we can use other symbols? It might not be strict. It says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is weird: we can't use pre-trained knowledge. We only rely on the error message. The error message is "syntax error". So we can't use knowledge of programming languages. But we can infer from the code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The syntax error is due to @ and #. So we can replace them with something else. The error message says "syntax error" meaning the code is not syntactically correct. So we can fix it by removing @ and #. So the fixed code could be: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That uses only standard symbols: if, else, parentheses, >, =, ;. That seems fine.

But the instruction: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So we just output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

I think that's the answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
