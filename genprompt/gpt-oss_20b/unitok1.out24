Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). This seems like they used Chinese quotation marks 《》 incorrectly. Should use braces or semicolons properly. The code likely intended to use curly braces but mistakenly used 《》. So we need to replace 《》 with {} or remove them. Let's interpret: The code uses "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;". But else block missing braces. Could be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, if we only need to use the error message and no pre-trained knowledge, we can just adjust the punctuation. But using curly braces is the standard. So final answer: triple backticks with code.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
