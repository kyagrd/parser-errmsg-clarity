Thinking...
We have an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. Hmm. The code has "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". The syntax looks like maybe something like Ruby? The "@" might be wrong. Also '#' is comment character. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe the code is:

if (x > 0)
  a = 1
else
  b = 2
end

But the posted code uses @? maybe a syntax from shell? However the error says else clause already closed, so the '#' might be in wrong place. They want us to remove the '#' after the else clause? Actually the code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The '#' indicates comment but they placed after else clause incorrectly. So the fix: remove the '#' before else and after else? Actually the error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe the code should be:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; 

But the '@' might be part of the code but seems wrong. Perhaps the '@' is a placeholder for something else. But maybe we keep it: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; 

We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquote. The code likely is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But that seems still weird. However given constraints, just remove the '#' after else clause. So the code becomes:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; 

Wrap in backticks. Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
