Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. Error message says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we have code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to adjust to syntax where maybe '《' and '》' are used as brackets? We need to use only symbols that appear in error message: '》', '《', 'if', 'else', maybe parentheses.

We need to close the if statement properly. Perhaps the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But error says unexpected '》' after else clause, meaning else already closed. The original had '》' after else. So we need to put else block inside brackets '《 ... 》', no trailing '》' after else. So correct: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Wait that ends with '》'. The error is that there is '》' after else clause, but that is okay if else clause is inside. But the error says after else clause if statement already closed. Means the closing '》' after else is wrong. So we should remove that outer '》' after else. So final code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;`. But we need braces maybe for else. But they want using only error message. We can produce:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But that's still '》' after else? Actually else is followed by '《 b = 2; 》', that is allowed.

Alternatively maybe we need to close after else: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. That includes two closing '》', one after a, one after b. That seems fine.

Thus output code: triple backticks and code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
