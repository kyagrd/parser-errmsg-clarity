Thinking...
We have error: syntax error. The code uses if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. This is likely a mix of syntax. For C-like languages: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That else requires a statement. Should be else { b = 2; }. Also remove trailing bracket.

Thus correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
