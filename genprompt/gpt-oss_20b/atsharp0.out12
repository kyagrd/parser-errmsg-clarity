Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message? That seems odd. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

It looks like a mix of JavaScript or C style. The '@' might be invalid. And '#' comments. We need to produce fixed code.

What language? It seems like C or JavaScript but with @. Let's assume JavaScript: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;.

Also the code had comments: # else b = 2; # might be wrong. Use // comments.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But they didn't ask to add braces? In JavaScript, if without braces only one statement. But we can keep simple: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But remove @ and #.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe comment with //: // else b = 2; But the code originally had both a and else comment. The fixed code should be syntactically correct. I'll propose:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need braces to be safe. I'll include braces:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

I'll output the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
