Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause. Code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

We need to produce fixed code only inside triple backticks. The language syntax may be different but we follow error: unexpected '}'. That means there is an extra closing brace. In if-else, we had opening brace after if, closed before else. else clause has no braces. Then we have extra '}' after else. Should remove that. So code should be: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Thus inside code block.

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
// fixed code
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
