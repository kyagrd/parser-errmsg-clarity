Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error indicates we have mismatched brackets. We should use braces {} or parentheses, but likely we should use {}. The correct syntax:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
