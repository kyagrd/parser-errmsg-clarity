Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses some Chinese quotation marks 《 and 》 instead of braces or parentheses. Also missing braces around if/else statements. Syntax error arises. But we can fix using only error message? They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on knowledge of typical syntax, but we must use the error message? The error message is "syntax error". Not very helpful.

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is odd: we cannot rely on pre-trained knowledge. But we are ChatGPT with knowledge. But maybe they want us to use the error message to locate the syntax error. But we can't produce an answer that uses pre-trained knowledge. But we still can fix it? Perhaps they want to replace the brackets with correct syntax.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus, fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe also need semicolon after b=2. Actually we need a semicolon after the statement within else. We can put semicolon after b=2;.

Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes. Output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
