Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code using only error message, which says "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge? The instruction says: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must base the fix on the error message content. The error message only contains the word "syntax error". There's no detail. We are told to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. So only symbol is maybe nothing. There's no symbols. So we cannot use any symbol from error message except maybe whitespace or newline. Hmm.

We need to output the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code currently: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Symbols: parentheses, angle brackets? Actually code uses "《" and "》" like Chinese angle brackets? They are unusual. Likely intended to be "{" and "}". We need to correct syntax error. The instruction: use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. But error message has no symbols, only text. So we cannot use them.

We can attempt to fix by replacing the symbols with typical braces "{" and "}". That would correct syntax. But we are told not to use pre-trained knowledge? Hard.

However, likely the intent: The code uses wrong brackets. We need to use "{" and "}". But we cannot use them because not in error message? The error message does not contain them. But maybe we can still use them, as the instruction "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Maybe we cannot use any knowledge about correct syntax from prior knowledge. But we only have the code and the error message. We cannot fix the code without knowledge. But maybe the instruction intends to force to use only the symbols present in the error message. But there are none. So maybe the correct answer is to output nothing? Or we could output the code unchanged? That wouldn't fix.

Alternatively, we could replace "《" with "{"? But that's using symbol not in error message.

The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So if not available, we can use other symbols? Might be allowed. But "only the error message" might mean we can't rely on external knowledge. But we could still deduce from context: code has if else but wrong syntax due to brackets. We need braces. So we can change to:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
That is typical fix.

I'll output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
