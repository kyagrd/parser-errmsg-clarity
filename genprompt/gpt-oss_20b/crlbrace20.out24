Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

It has an extra closing brace at the end. Should remove that. Also missing braces for else? It's fine: else b = 2; is acceptable. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
