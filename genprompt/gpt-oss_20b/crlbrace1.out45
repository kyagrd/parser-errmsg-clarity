Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause, because we have an extra closing brace. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to remove the last '}'. Also else clause should have braces or not? else b = 2; is okay but we have missing braces around else? No, it's fine: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; but the syntax error is due to the trailing '}'. So fix: remove trailing '}'. Also, the else clause syntax is okay: else b = 2; but it's better to add braces: else { b = 2; }? But not necessary. The error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So just remove the trailing }.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
