Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. There's mismatched brackets. Likely intended to use parentheses or braces. The syntax may be like if (condition) [ statements ] else [ statements ]. So we need to close the else block properly: after else b = 2; ]? It seems they used one bracket for if block and one for else block. They used only one opening bracket for if block, then closing bracket after a = 1; . But then they used else b = 2; ] - they forgot opening bracket for else. So we can add an opening bracket before else: else [ b = 2; ]. But the error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the extra closing bracket after else? Let's examine:

Original:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Positions: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

We have:

- Opening bracket before a = 1;.
- Closing bracket after a = 1;.
- Then else b = 2; ] - no opening bracket, but a closing bracket at end. So syntax error. So fix: add opening bracket before else, and remove trailing closing bracket? Actually we need matching bracket pairs: [ ... ] for if block, [ ... ] for else block. So after else we need opening bracket, then b = 2; then closing bracket. But there is already a closing bracket at end. So we can change else b = 2; ] to else [ b = 2; ]. So the final code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. That should fix the error. The error message also indicates that else clause was already closed. So yes.

Thus output: triple backticks with fixed code.
...done thinking.
