Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet: 

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)

So we need to correct brackets. Probably should use braces {} or parentheses but we can use only symbols that appear in error message: ']' and else clause. Actually error message says unexpected ']' after else clause, if statement already closed. So we need to remove trailing ']' at end, and maybe adjust brackets. So correct code likely:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But also the closing of if statement maybe uses ']' too? But code uses [ for block, but else clause after it: else b = 2; and then trailing ] extra. So we just remove that. Also perhaps need closing bracket for if block? It already has [ a=1; ]. That's fine.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

That is only change: remove trailing ]. Probably no other change.

Return only fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
