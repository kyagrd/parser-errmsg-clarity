Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses '《' and '》' as some delimiters around statements. The syntax: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That likely means we shouldn't close the if block with '》' before the else. The syntax maybe: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》? But the error indicates after else, there's a '》' that is unexpected, so we need to remove it. Also the if statement is closed before else; we need to keep the '》' after the else block, not before else. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The last '》' is after the else block, but maybe the syntax expects the '》' to close the else block. But we have not opened an else block. Perhaps we need to wrap the else block in '《' and '》' too. So correct: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Remove the trailing semicolon after else? But keep semicolon inside block. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. This uses '》' after else. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The cause: we closed if before else. So we need to keep '》' after else block but not before else. So final code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
