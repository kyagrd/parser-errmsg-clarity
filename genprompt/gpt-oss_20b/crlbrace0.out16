Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There is an extra closing brace at the end. Also the else block is missing braces. Syntax error because unmatched braces or else without braces might still be okay in many languages. But the extra brace is wrong. So fix by removing the last `}`. Also maybe wrap else statement with braces or keep as `else b = 2;`. But the code likely intended: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Add braces to else for clarity. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
No trailing `}`. That's correct.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
