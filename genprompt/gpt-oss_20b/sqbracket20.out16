Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, using only error message "syntax error". We must produce fixed code inside triple backquotes. They say note syntax may be different. Use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message "syntax error" only contains words "syntax" and "error". We might need to use these words? Or we can use symbol that appears in error message: there is space, no punctuation. So we can't use symbols like parentheses? We are told to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. But there are no symbols. So maybe we can't? We can only use symbols that appear in error message. There are none. So we cannot use any symbols? That seems impossible. Maybe we just produce code with no syntax errors, but still only use symbols that appear in error message? Since we cannot use any symbols, we cannot write anything? Maybe we can just output empty code? That might be considered fixed? But we still need to produce code. Let's think: The error message "syntax error" contains letters and space. So we can only use letters and space. So we could write something like "syntax error". But that is not code. But maybe we can output code that is just "syntax error". But that seems nonsense.

Wait, the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we should only look at the error message, not at knowledge of syntax. The error message says "syntax error". That indicates there's a syntax error, but we cannot know what exactly. But maybe the code is wrong because of mismatched brackets. The original code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

There is an extra closing bracket. So to fix, we can remove the extra bracket at end. Also perhaps use parentheses instead of brackets. But we can't use parentheses? Wait, the code uses parentheses already: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. There is an extra bracket at the end. We can fix by removing the last ]. So code becomes:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But there might still be mismatched brackets? The opening bracket is after if. Closing after a = 1; So brackets matched. So fixed code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

Thus we need to output that inside triple backticks.

But instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we don't need to know exact syntax. We just need to remove the last bracket. So we produce:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

That uses only characters that were in original code. No new symbols. So it's fine. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
