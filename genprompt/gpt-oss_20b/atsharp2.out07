Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY error message. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The error message suggests that after else clause there is a '#' that is unexpected because else is closed. Also the code uses `@` after if condition. Maybe the language expects something like `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The '#' characters likely denote comments, but the error says unexpected '#' after else clause. So we need to remove the '#' after else. Also the `@` might be an error. We need to fix the syntax: maybe we should replace `@` with a space. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Output code only.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
