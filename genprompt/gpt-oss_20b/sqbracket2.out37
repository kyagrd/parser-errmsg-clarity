Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code: The original code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]` There's syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the stray closing bracket at the end. Also maybe need brackets consistency: use [ ... ] for then part, else part maybe also need brackets? But error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we simply remove that last ]. The code becomes: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` But else part has no brackets, maybe fine. Keep same syntax. Output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
