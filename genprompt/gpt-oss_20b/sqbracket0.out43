Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message, but we can fix code. The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The syntax is wrong. Should use curly braces or no braces. Also extra closing bracket at end. Correct code likely: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` but else requires braces? In C-like syntax, you can omit braces if single statement. So: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That's simplest. The extra `]` removed. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
