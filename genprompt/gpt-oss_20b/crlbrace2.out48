Thinking...
The user wants: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block. Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. DO NOT output your thinking process. ONLY output what was asked."

So we need to produce only the fixed code. The original code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)".

The error indicates there's an extra closing brace '}'. Indeed, the if statement opened with `{` after `if (x > 0)`, and closed with `}` after `a = 1;`. Then `else b = 2;` no braces. Then an extra `}` after that. So remove the extra '}'. The corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That should be fine. There is no error. So output inside triple backticks. The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we don't need to add braces for else. Just remove extra. Also use only symbols that appear in the error message. The error message has symbols: '}', 'else', 'if', '('. The fixed code uses '}'. But it's not an error. But they said "use symbols that appear in error message, if available." So it's fine.

We just output the fixed code inside triple backticks. No extra text.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
