Thinking...
The user wants: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block." They give an error message: "syntax error". We need to fix the code. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We must fix syntax error. The code uses "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". There is mismatched brackets. Likely we need to use parentheses or braces consistently. Possibly they intended: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

But they want to use symbols that appear in the error message if available. Error message "syntax error" doesn't give symbols. But we can still fix. We should output only the fixed code in triple backticks. Probably the expected answer is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But there's still a trailing ]. We need to remove last ]. Let's think. Original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. There are mismatched brackets: opening [ after condition, closing ] after a=1, then else b=2; then trailing ].

Could we change to parentheses? But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only says "syntax error". There's no symbols to use. So we just fix the syntax logically.

So we need to ensure balanced brackets. The simplest fix: replace [ with {, and replace ] with }. Then the code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. That seems correct. So final output: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should output only this.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
