Thinking...
The user requests: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

They want only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

They want to use only the error message "syntax error". They say "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

The error message is just "syntax error". They say "use symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only has the word "syntax error". No symbols like parentheses or braces. So we can't add symbols. They want to fix the error but only using the error message? This is odd. Maybe we can just correct the code using parentheses and braces as usual. But the instruction says "using ONLY the error message". That might mean we should not use external knowledge, only the error message. But the error message has no symbols. So maybe we can output the corrected code, but not mention anything else. They don't want any thinking. Just the corrected code.

The original code has mismatched braces: There are two opening braces: after if (x > 0) and after else? Wait:

`if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

We see:
- if (x > 0)
- { a = 1; } -> open { after if, closed after a=1; so balanced.
- else b = 2; -> no braces for else.
- Then a stray } at end.

So the stray } should be removed. Also else part might need braces to group statements? Not necessary if only one statement. So fix by removing the stray }.

Thus corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`

But there might be missing braces for else? But if it's a single statement, it's fine. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Now output inside triple backticks.

No extra text.

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
