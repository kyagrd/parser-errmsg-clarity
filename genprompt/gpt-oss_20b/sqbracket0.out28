Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Observations: It uses brackets [ ] instead of curly braces or nothing. Also unmatched bracket at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe the original intention was simple single statements: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Without braces. And remove stray bracket.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Or if braces needed: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Use minimal change: remove brackets and stray ].

Thus answer: output code block.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
