Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, using only error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems odd: we cannot use pre-trained knowledge, only error message. But we can deduce: "syntax error" is ambiguous. We need to provide corrected code. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

We need to produce fixed code. They want only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

We need to produce code that is syntactically correct. The original code seems like maybe pseudo code, but we can assume it's JavaScript or C-like. The syntax error arises from `@` and the comment with `#`. Also missing braces. We can fix by removing `@`, using braces, or maybe using `:`? The simplest: `if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;`. But they want `else` clause? The code currently has `else b = 2;` commented out with `#`. We can use `//` comments.

Thus corrected code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```

But if we want full else: 
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error" - maybe just minimal. I'd output the fixed code. They didn't specify language, but we can assume JavaScript or C.

I'll output:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```
But maybe we need to remove `#` comment characters, which are invalid in many languages except Python. But the code also has `@`. So I'd rewrite:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Thus I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
