Thinking...
We have error: syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There is an extra closing brace after else. Also else needs braces or semicolon? Usually if-else needs braces if block has multiple statements, but here else has one statement, but no braces. The extra '}' at end. Also the else statement missing braces? It's fine to have else without braces for single statement. So remove the last '}'. Also maybe need braces around else statement if needed. But we just need to remove the extra closing brace. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That is the corrected code.

We output only that code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
