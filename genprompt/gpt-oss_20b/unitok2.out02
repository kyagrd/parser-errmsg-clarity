Thinking...
We need to output fixed code inside triple backquote. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses special angle brackets 《 and 》 presumably as delimiters. The error indicates unexpected '》' after else clause because if statement already closed. So maybe the syntax uses brackets to start and end the block. Perhaps the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

We need to place 《 before else block. The error shows the else clause already closed by '》'. So we need to move the closing bracket after the else block. So:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Double-check: The if statement starts, then block between 《 and 》. After that else should start a new block: else 《 b = 2; 》. That likely fixes.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Use triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
