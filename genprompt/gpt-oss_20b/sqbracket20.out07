Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in the code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We have syntax error: likely mismatched brackets. The code uses if with parentheses, then square brackets as code block. There is an unmatched closing bracket at the end. The else part is not enclosed in brackets. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Also the stray ']' at end should be removed. Also the 'else' block maybe should be [ ].

But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Output only the fixed code." The error message just says "syntax error". So we can't use external knowledge? But we can infer minimal change: remove stray bracket. Also the else part missing brackets.

We could simply change to:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Remove last ']' and enclose else body. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if syntax allows else block without brackets: but the original code uses brackets for first block, so likely need brackets for else too. So final code: above.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
