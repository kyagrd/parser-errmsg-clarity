Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message and symbols that appear in error message, which is "syntax error". So we cannot rely on knowledge of language. We need to output fixed code inside triple backticks. The code uses unusual symbols 《 and 》. The error may be due to mismatched parentheses or syntax. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to correct it with minimal changes, using only symbols that appear in error message. The error message only contains the words syntax error. No symbols. So we cannot use any special symbols? But the instructions say "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." There are no symbols besides spaces. So we can't use special symbols? But we might need to replace 《 with { and 》 with }. But those are not in error message. Perhaps we need to just remove the symbols and keep parentheses. So the code could be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But curly braces are not in error message. But we are allowed to use the error message's symbols. There are none. So maybe we keep the same symbols but add missing parentheses? The code has one opening parentheses before x > 0. It closes after > 0). That's fine. Then "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". There is an extra closing bracket at end. Perhaps we need to remove the trailing 》. Also we might need to close the 《 block with 》. The block appears to have matching 》 after a=1; and a final 》 after else? Wait: The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. Let's annotate: 
- after if, there is 《, then a=1; then 》, so that block is closed. Then else b = 2; 》. So else part is `b = 2; 》`. The 》 after else part is extraneous. So we can just remove the last 》. So fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
This uses only existing symbols and just removes trailing. But the syntax might still be wrong if the language expects block after else but no block braces. But since we cannot add new symbols, we keep it. Let's output that.

But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Since no symbols, we can't add new ones. So we remove the extraneous 》. Provide code inside triple backticks.

Thus final output: triple backticks with code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
