Thinking...
We have a user instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

So there is a syntax error. The user wants us to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. They say: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

The error message: "syntax error"

We have no symbols from that message except "syntax" "error". But maybe they want us to use the brackets "《" and "》" and the "else" as part of a custom language. The code uses these weird brackets. Possibly the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But the original had a stray "》" after the else? Actually original: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. That suggests they forgot to wrap the else body in brackets. The syntax error could be due to missing brackets. So fix: wrap else block with 《 and 》. Also maybe missing semicolon? But they had semicolons inside. The else part: `b = 2;`. Should be inside brackets. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

We don't add other changes.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Return that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
