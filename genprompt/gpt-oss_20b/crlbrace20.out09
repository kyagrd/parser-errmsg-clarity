Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
It has syntax error: likely stray closing brace. We should remove the extra '}'. The code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
