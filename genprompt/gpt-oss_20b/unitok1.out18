Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They provide an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They want a fixed code. The issue is that the code uses unusual characters 《 and 》 instead of braces {} or proper syntax. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The error indicates that the '》' after else clause is unexpected. So we need to change the syntax to correct it. Usually we would use braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. But we have to use the error message. The error message indicates that the else clause has a '》' after it. So we need to remove the stray '》' after else or before else. Actually the code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The code uses 《 as opening and 》 as closing, but then after else there's no opening. It closes incorrectly. The error says after else clause, if statement already closed, so the '》' after else is unexpected. So we need to remove the '》' after else or add a corresponding opening before else. But typical fix: remove the last 》, so the code ends after else b = 2; That would leave the else clause. However the code is still syntactically wrong because the else clause is not enclosed properly. But maybe they want to keep the syntax similar: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. But that would have two 》 after else. But the error indicates that if statement already closed before else, so the '》' after else is unexpected. So we need to change the code to something like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot add knowledge about braces. But we can interpret error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests that the closing bracket '》' should not be there. So we should remove that. Also the opening bracket '《' before a = 1; is also wrong because we didn't close after else. But maybe they want to replace 《 with '{' and 》 with '}'. But no pre-trained knowledge. We only rely on the error message. The error message indicates the unexpected '》' after else clause. So we should delete that. Also we need to fix the opening bracket for else. But maybe the code originally uses 《 as opening and 》 as closing. The if statement had opening 《 and closing 》. After else we have b = 2; 》. So maybe the code expects that else should also have opening and closing. But the error indicates that after else there's a closing 》 that is unexpected because the if statement is already closed. So we could restructure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That would have closing after else as part of else block. But the error would still be "unexpected '》' after else clause" because there is a closing after else. But if we have opening before else, it's fine. The error arises because there's no opening. So we should add a '《' before else. So the code becomes: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That would fix the error because the else clause is opened by a '《' and closed by '》'.

Thus the fixed code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. They didn't mention braces. We need to preserve the '《' and '》' syntax? Possibly the code is using Chinese angle brackets as placeholder. They want to fix syntax error but keep that style. So we can just add the missing opening. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But maybe they want to close the else block after b = 2; The original code had the '》' after else. So maybe the correct syntax is if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. But that is wrong. So we change to if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That uses the '》' after else but with opening before else. That is consistent.

Thus output only the fixed code inside triple backquote.

We must output only code block. So:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
