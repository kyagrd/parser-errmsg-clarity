Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to output fixed code. They say use ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. Error message: "syntax error". So we need to use symbols that appear in error message if available. Error message contains "syntax error". But we can't use pre-trained knowledge. So we just need to correct syntax: maybe the original uses some weird brackets 《 and 》. We need to replace with proper parentheses or curly braces. So the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But we can also keep parentheses and semicolons. But we need to match style. The original had parentheses around condition, then 《 and 》 around statements. We can replace with {}.

Thus output: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Also maybe need to add newline. But output inside triple backticks.

Given instructions: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So just that.

I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
