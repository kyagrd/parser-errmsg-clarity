Thinking...
We have code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). It seems the syntax uses unusual Chinese quotation characters. They are "《" and "》". The correct syntax in many languages (like C, Java, JavaScript) uses parentheses for condition and braces for block: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. But the error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the else clause maybe ended prematurely due to '》'. The code is likely a generic snippet for some language that uses '《' '》' to denote block? But typical syntax: if (condition) <block> else <block>.

Maybe the language expects 'else' to be followed by block in '《》' style. The code has 'if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》', but there's a stray '》' after else. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》;
```

But the error message says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code closed the if before else, so the else is not expected. To fix, we need to close else block properly. The snippet likely uses `《` to start block and `》` to end block. The `else` clause should be followed by a block like `else 《 b = 2; 》;`. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》;
```

But we need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》;
```

That's it.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》;
```
