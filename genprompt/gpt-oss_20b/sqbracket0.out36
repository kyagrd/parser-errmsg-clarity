Thinking...
The user says "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message is just "syntax error" (not specific). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax. Likely language is C or JavaScript? It uses if (x > 0). The brackets are wrong. Should be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

Also there is an extra ']' at the end. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
