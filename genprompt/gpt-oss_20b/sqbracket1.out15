Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. But we as ChatGPT have knowledge. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The syntax is wrong. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That suggests we only use the error message to infer corrections. But we can still provide the fixed code. So we output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instruction maybe expecting that we remove the stray closing bracket after else. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to change [ to { and ] to }. Also we need to add braces after else. And remove the last ]. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.

Return only that code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
