Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only error message. Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the last ']' after else clause. Also maybe close the else block correctly. The syntax uses brackets [] as block delimiters instead of braces. So correct code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. But we need to use only symbols that appear in error message? It says "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message shows ']' after else clause. We should remove that trailing ']' maybe. But the code might be intended to have a matching '[' after else. In the code, after else, there's no '[' but a ']' is after else. Wait code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. After else, we have "b = 2; ]". That ']' closes? There's no opening '[' for else block. So we should add '[' before b or remove ']' after else. But error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates the parser expected else block to start with '[' but got ']'? So we need to remove the trailing ']' after else or replace with '['. But the error says ']' after else clause, which is unexpected. So we could change ']' after else clause to '['? But then we would have 'b = 2; [' which still might be wrong. Actually proper would be: else [ b = 2; ]. So we need to replace the stray ']' after else with '['. Also need closing ']' after b. So final code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. That uses symbols from error message: brackets. This seems plausible. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
