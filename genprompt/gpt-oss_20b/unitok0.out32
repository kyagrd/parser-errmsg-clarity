Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. Means we should only use the error message "syntax error" and code. But obviously we need to produce corrected code. The error message is not detailed. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses Chinese angle brackets? The code uses special characters: 《 and 》. Should be curly braces {}? The syntax is like if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; but else must also be in braces. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Thus we output fixed code inside triple backticks. Use just code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
