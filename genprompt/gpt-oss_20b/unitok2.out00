Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. Original: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). It indicates that after else, there's a '》' that closes the if prematurely. The code uses Chinese quotation-like 《 and 》 to wrap code blocks. We need to correct. Perhaps structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. But error says after else clause, unexpected '》', meaning there's an extra closing symbol. Let's propose fixed code: 

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
But that might still close after else? The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That suggests that the if block has been closed before else. In the original, after if block '》', else appears but no opening '《' for else. So we need to wrap else block with 《 and 》. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Provide that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
