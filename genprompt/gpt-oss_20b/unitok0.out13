Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```"

They want to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. We must fix the syntax error. The original code uses weird angle brackets: "《" and "》". It probably intends to use parentheses or braces. In many languages, the if syntax is if (condition) { statement; } else { statement; }.

We need to fix using only the error message? The error message is "syntax error". That is ambiguous. But they want to fix the code. We can produce corrected code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to output only that inside triple backticks. Ensure no extra commentary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
