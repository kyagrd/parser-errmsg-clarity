Thinking...
We have error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to fix syntax error, using only the error message. The error says there's an unexpected '#' after else clause. Actually the code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. That looks like wrong syntax: uses `@`? Also the else clause is inside comment '#', but else isn't recognized. We need to write valid code: maybe `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Use braces. But we can't add anything beyond? They ask to use only the error message. That means we can correct by removing '#' and adding else. Let's produce: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But need braces? In many languages, `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` is okay in C-like languages? In C, you cannot have else after semicolon. You need braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So better to correct that.

Also '@' is wrong. Should be just `a = 1`. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We keep code inside triple backquotes.

Thus final output: just that code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
