Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we can produce correct code. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra closing brace at end. Also missing braces for else? Actually else has no braces. That's okay but syntax wise it's fine. The error arises due to stray '}'. So remove last '}'. Also the else clause missing braces not causing syntax error? else b = 2; is fine. So fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;.

But ensure proper semicolons etc. So output only code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
