Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We see "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" - wrong symbol "@"? Should be assignment? In many languages, if statement uses "then" or "do" etc. But maybe it's pseudo-code. We want to remove '#' comments. Also else b=2; But syntax? Should be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
But error message indicates after else clause there's '#'. So we should rewrite code accordingly. They want to use only error message to fix code. But we need produce fixed code. So let's output the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But still have syntax? Actually "if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;" is fine in C? In C, the else is optional. The code can be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But there might be missing braces. But that's fine. But maybe the error refers to else clause after closed. In code they had: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". So the '#' removed. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we also remove '@'. The '@' may have been a mistake. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively add braces. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Which one is more correct? The problem says "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message". That implies we should only use the information from the error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we remove the '#' after else clause. Also "if statement already closed" indicates that there was no else. But we need to ensure correct syntax. Remove the '#' characters. Also the '@' might be a typo; maybe they meant '=>'. But it's unknown. They likely want to remove the '#' and '@'.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
