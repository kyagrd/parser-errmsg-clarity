Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. That means we must interpret the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We want to fix syntax. It's likely C-like syntax, maybe JavaScript, but the original uses square brackets incorrectly. The fix should use braces {}. So replace [ with { and ] with } appropriately. The else clause is missing braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We also might need to remove extra closing bracket at the end. So final answer: inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
