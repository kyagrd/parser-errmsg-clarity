Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means after else, there should not be '#' maybe comment or something. We need to use only the error message, so maybe remove the '#', or comment properly. Code may be some custom language where '@' after if? Might be syntax: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; But the '# else' part has a '#'. So fix by removing '#'. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That should be correct. Use code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
