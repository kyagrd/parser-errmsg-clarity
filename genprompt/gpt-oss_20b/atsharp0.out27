Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But obviously we have to produce correct code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This is likely intended as JavaScript or something. The error syntax: because of '@' is not valid, also the comment markers '#'. Use C-like comment // or /* */. Also need else statement properly. The code could be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But to keep the comment we can remove #. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But ensure proper semicolons. That is correct. Or we could use braces:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Better. Let's output fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
