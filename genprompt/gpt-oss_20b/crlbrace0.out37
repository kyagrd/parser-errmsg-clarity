Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error only using the error message "syntax error". They want us to produce the fixed code. The error in code: unmatched braces: the else statement has no braces and there's an extra closing brace. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The correct code would be either:

Option 1: add braces around else block: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` and remove extra brace at end. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Option 2: remove braces: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` but then unmatched braces removed. But we must keep the same style maybe. Let's produce the cleaned code.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That seems correct. Ensure only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
