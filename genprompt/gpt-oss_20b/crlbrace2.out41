Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There's an extra closing brace after else. Should remove it. So fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But the else clause syntax might require braces around else body if single statement? The code may use braces for if body only. else body is single statement without braces, fine. Extra '}' removed. Ensure only fix. Output only code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
