Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error: The code uses Chinese brackets 《 and 》 instead of braces { }. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to replace 《 with { and 》 with } appropriately. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But note that else part needs braces too? Not necessary. The last 》 after else might close if block? In original code: `else b = 2; 》`. That final 》 maybe extraneous? Actually the code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. There is an extra 》 after else statement. So we should remove it. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Thus output only the fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
