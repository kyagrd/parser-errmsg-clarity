Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Original code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So after else we have "b = 2; 》". So need to close the if statement properly before else? The code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters? Perhaps intended syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } but uses 《 and 》 instead of braces. In this code, there is an extra closing delimiter after else. Actually pattern: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The 》 after else incorrectly placed. Should remove final 》. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
But maybe need closing 》 after else block too. But else block only contains b = 2; So syntax might be if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. They used 《 and 》 to delimit code blocks. So correct code would be:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
But original had no 《 before else. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the last 》. So fixed code is: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
But maybe also need to close after else with 》? The error: after else clause, an unexpected 》. Means that after else there's a 》. We should not have 》 after else. So remove it. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
But the code may still be syntactically wrong if else block not closed? But maybe else block doesn't require delimiters. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
