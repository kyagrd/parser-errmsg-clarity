Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). We have an extra '}' at the end. Also else clause is missing braces but that might be okay: else b = 2; is valid C style, but the extra '}' closes nothing. So remove the last '}'. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe they want to keep consistent braces? The error is extra '}'. Remove it. So final output: triple backticks with code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
