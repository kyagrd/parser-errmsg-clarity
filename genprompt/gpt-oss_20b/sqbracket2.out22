Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax using symbols that appear in error message. The error mentions ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove the extra ']' at the end. Also correct brackets? The code uses '[' for then block. Might need to use correct closing. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause. So we can remove the final ']' after else block. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Also maybe the closing of else block? There is no opening '[' for else. But we can keep as is. So answer code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
