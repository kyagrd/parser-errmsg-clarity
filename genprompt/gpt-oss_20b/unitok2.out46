Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code snippet. It uses unconventional symbols: "《" and "》". The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to output only fixed code in triple backquotes. Use symbols from error message: '》' appears, also '《'. The language maybe uses 《 to open a block, and 》 to close. In current code, the else clause uses "else b = 2; 》" where 》 is after else clause. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the 》 after else is misplaced. Should close the if block before else. So correct structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》? But else should have its own block. Maybe they intended to open else block with 《 and close with 》. So fix: 

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But we need to remove the trailing 》 after else. The trailing 》 at end of line is probably extraneous. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But we need to ensure closing 》 after else. The error said unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means they closed the if block before else. So we need to move the closing 》 after else block. So yes. Provide final code.

Check: The code originally had `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. We will output: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. That uses both symbols correctly.

Thus output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
