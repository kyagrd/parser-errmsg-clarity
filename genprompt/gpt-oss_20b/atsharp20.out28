Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. Since we only have the error message "syntax error". There's no hint on language; the code uses @ and # which are unusual. Could be like a macro language or custom. They say syntax may be different; use symbols that appear in error message, if available. But error message is just "syntax error" no symbols. We need to guess.

Maybe the issue is using @ instead of something else. Could be that it's supposed to be a keyword or operator. We could change @ to a colon or something. But we don't know.

We might just replace @ with an operator like '='? The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` The # might comment. Maybe the language uses # for comments. So the code is: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The @ is not valid. Maybe it should be 'then'. So: `if (x > 0) then a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. That might be more correct. But we don't know.

We might consider that the code originally is a mix of pseudocode. We need to fix syntax error. The only error likely is @. So replace @ with `=`? But there is already `= 1;`. So maybe @ is some operator. I think better to change to `:`. So: `if (x > 0) : a = 1; # else b = 2; #`.

But maybe the language uses '=>' for condition? But unclear.

We just need to output code inside backticks.

Let's choose: `if (x > 0) then a = 1; # else b = 2; #`.

That uses 'then', which is a keyword in many languages.

We output that.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) then a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
