Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses Chinese brackets 《 and 》. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems the closing bracket after else is unexpected. Perhaps the correct syntax: after else we don't need another closing bracket. Maybe the structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》? But the error indicates after else clause the '》' is unexpected because if statement already closed. So we need to close else block properly: maybe replace closing bracket with something else. We can only use symbols in error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we can maybe replace the last '》' with nothing or replace with another bracket like ？ But we must use only symbols that appear in error message. The error message only contains '》' and maybe '(' and ')' etc. The code uses 《 and 》. The error indicates that after else, a '》' appears unexpectedly. So we can remove that '》' at the end. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But also maybe need to close the if block. The 《 a = 1; 》 closes the if block. Then else b = 2; is fine. So we remove the trailing '》'. So output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
