Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: there is an extra closing brace '}' after else clause. Also the else branch should be in braces or not; currently else b = 2; no braces. After else, we need to remove the closing brace. Also if we want to keep consistent formatting, maybe braces around else block? But we can just remove the stray '}'. The code becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Alternatively, else block might need braces: else { b = 2; }

Given error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove '}'. So final code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Output only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
