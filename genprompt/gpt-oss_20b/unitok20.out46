Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code uses special brackets 《 and 》, likely syntax errors. The error message is "syntax error". We have to use only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. But we need to produce a fixed code using symbols that appear in the error message? It says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That might be a trick: we should only use the word "syntax" and "error" maybe. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only says "syntax error". So the symbols that appear are space and the words syntax, error. But we can't use punctuation. This is ambiguous. However, maybe the intent is that we can use only the characters from the error message: "syntax error" includes letters s y n t a x e r r o r and space. No brackets or parentheses. So we can only use those letters and space. But we need to produce code that compiles? The original code is something like:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to replace the special brackets 《 》 with something that uses only letters from "syntax error". Maybe we can use "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }" but that uses braces { }. Those are not in the error message. But the instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Hard.

Possibly they mean we should only use the error message text to guess that it's a syntax error because of the special brackets. So we should replace 《 a = 1; 》 with { a = 1; } and 》 at end maybe is extraneous. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 
```

But missing else block parentheses? Actually we need else { b = 2; }. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But this uses braces. The instruction maybe doesn't forbid braces. The phrase "using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge." This might be a puzzle: you can't use knowledge of syntax, only the error message. But you can still produce a corrected code with braces. I'll output the fixed code.

Given typical languages, that should be correct.

Let's output only the code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
