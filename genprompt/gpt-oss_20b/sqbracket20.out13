Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. The error message is "syntax error" generic. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax. The original code uses [ ] but maybe they intended { }. We also have an extra closing ] at end. Also else missing braces. So we can replace brackets with braces, remove trailing ]. Also else clause missing braces, but maybe allowed to be single statement.

Fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also could use single statements: but better to have braces. No trailing ]. So final answer: code block with that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
