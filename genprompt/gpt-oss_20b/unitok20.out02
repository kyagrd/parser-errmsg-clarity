Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error message is "syntax error". There's no details. We need to produce fixed code. The code uses symbols "《" and "》" maybe incorrectly. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to change to a syntax that uses these symbols? The error message only says "syntax error". But we need to output fixed code inside triple backticks. Possibly change the angled brackets to braces or parentheses.

The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is "syntax error" which contains no symbols. So we can't use that. Maybe we just fix to correct syntax: replace 《 with { and 》 with } and ensure braces match. Also the final "》" after else may be stray.

So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But we need to keep the original brackets? The instruction: "The syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we might be allowed to use custom brackets. But we can replace 《 with { and 》 with }.

Also need to close the outer bracket? The original had "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". That suggests maybe they intended to use 《 as opening for if body and 》 as closing. Then the else part also uses a block? The final 》 might close the else block? But it's after else b=2; 》. That might be a mistake: else should have a block too: 《b = 2; 》 maybe. So we need to place both blocks correctly: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That is likely correct.

Thus final code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
But we need to ensure no trailing semicolon after else? The code might be: else b = 2; So we can write else 《 b = 2; 》.

Thus produce code with same symbols: keep 《 and 》 as block delimiters. So the final code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But the original had a stray 》 after the else. We'll remove that. Add proper spacing.

Therefore output: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But we need to close the final 》? Already closed.

Thus final output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
