Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace. Also missing braces around else. Suppose language syntax uses C-like. We can write `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That should fix. Also maybe missing parentheses for else? The error message: "syntax error" generic. They want to use only error message symbols: "syntax error" has no symbols. They say "try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." There are no symbols in "syntax error" except letters. We can ignore that. Provide fixed code.

Return only code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
