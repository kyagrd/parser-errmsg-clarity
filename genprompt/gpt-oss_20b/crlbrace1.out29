Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: there's an extra '}' after else clause. Also need to add braces around else block? Actually original: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace at the end. So remove the last '}'. Also maybe else should be enclosed in braces if you want multiple statements, but it's single assignment so it's fine. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That is the fixed code. Need to output inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
