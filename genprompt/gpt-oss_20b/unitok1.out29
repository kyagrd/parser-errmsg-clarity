Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses wrong symbols '《' and '》' instead of braces or parentheses. We can replace with appropriate block syntax. In C-like languages, use {}. So:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But maybe they want to preserve semicolons? Also else block maybe need braces for consistency: else { b = 2; }

Thus final code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Let's provide.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
