Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. We have code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). This implies that there's a stray # after else clause. Also there's a @? Might be some syntax weirdness. We need to produce the fixed code.

We need to use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we can still interpret.

Given code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. It looks like maybe a typo: "@" should be "then" or something. But we can produce something like: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` removing the #. The code likely expects some language syntax. The code uses semicolons and parentheses. Could be C-like? In C, you need braces if multiple statements. But it's a single assignment. So the code is fine if we remove # and @.

Thus the fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The # after else removed.

Wrap in triple backticks.

The instruction: Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block.

So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe they want to keep the same structure: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" maybe '@' is a directive. But error message says unexpected '#' after else clause. Actually code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The '#' is a comment in many languages. In C, '#' starts a preprocessor directive; after else clause it's wrong. So the comment after else is wrong. So we need to remove '#' after else or before else. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. So we can remove the '#' before else or after. Probably the comment should be before if or after the if, not inside else. So we can rewrite: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` or with comment: `# if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the instruction: use only error message, no pre-trained knowledge. So we need to apply the minimal change: remove the '#' after else. The code becomes `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; #`. But still there's an error with '@'? However the instruction might not care about '@'. But we could keep it.

But perhaps the expected fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But still we have '#', removed. So the final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But I'm not sure.

Better to produce code without the '#' and '@', since they might be errors. But instruction: fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. That means only addressing the '#' error. So keep the rest as is. So output: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. This removes only '#'. So final.

Thus I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
