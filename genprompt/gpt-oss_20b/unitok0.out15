Thinking...
We have a syntax error. We only can use the error message, but no pre-trained knowledge? Actually the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we should rely on error message alone? The error message is just "syntax error". That's generic. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

This looks like someone used wrong brackets: 《 and 》 instead of curly braces or parentheses. The correct syntax in many languages would be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. Or maybe they want to remove the braces? But we need to correct syntax. Since the code uses `if (x > 0)`, which is typical in C-like languages. The braces need to be {}.

So we fix to:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. That is the answer.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
