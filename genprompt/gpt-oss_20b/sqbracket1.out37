Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only error message. The error says: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
So using brackets incorrectly. We need to replace brackets with braces or parentheses. The correct syntax in C-like language: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Also remove extra bracket at end. So final code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
