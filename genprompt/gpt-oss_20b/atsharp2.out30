Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. They used `@` maybe for assignment? The code says `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error message says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the problem is that after `else` there's a `#` comment marker. In many languages, '#' starts comment. The else clause is closed already? Actually the if statement uses `@ a = 1;` maybe that closes the if? But the else is preceded by a `#`. So the fix: remove the `#` before else, or after else. Possibly the code should be: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. Also remove trailing '#'.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. Provide inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
