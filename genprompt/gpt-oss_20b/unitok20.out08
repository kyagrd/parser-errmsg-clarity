Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message: "syntax error". Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They want to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. We must use only the error message, i.e., "syntax error". And we should try to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only says "syntax error". There are no symbols in that. But we can maybe guess that the error is due to mismatched brackets or use of wrong brackets.

The code uses unusual brackets: 《 and 》. It looks like the opening bracket is a Chinese full-width left angle bracket, then a statement, then a closing bracket. Then after that else b = 2; 》 has an extra closing bracket? Actually code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. So there's an opening bracket after if, and then closing bracket after a=1, then else b=2; and then an extra closing bracket. So the error is maybe an extra bracket.

We need to fix syntax error. Probably correct code is: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;`. Remove the extra 》 at the end. But they said to use only the error message. There's no guidance. However, we can produce corrected code with normal brackets maybe: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But they might want to keep the same style but fix syntax. The simplest is remove last bracket.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But maybe need to close else block? Might need braces. But likely they just want to remove the stray bracket.

Thus output code inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
