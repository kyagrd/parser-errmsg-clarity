Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. They mention error message: syntax error. Use symbols that appear in error message? The error message is just "syntax error". It contains no symbols. But instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." There are none. So we just output corrected code. Syntax might be some custom language. Maybe `if` condition, then statements. They used `@` instead of `then`. And comments using `#`. Possibly the language uses `@` for assignments? The syntax: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error is syntax, maybe because of missing `then` or missing braces. We can use braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But they used semicolons, comments. Let's output something like that.

We need to output only fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That is standard syntax. Or maybe `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But given the weird code, I think braces.

So final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
