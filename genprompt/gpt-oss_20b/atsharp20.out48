Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, which is just "syntax error". We must output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We don't know language. There's an @ and #. Maybe syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But given code uses @ and #. Could be some language where @ and # are part of comments? Or maybe @ is annotation? But we need to fix syntax error using only symbols that appear in error message. The error message contains "syntax error". That doesn't give us symbols. It says "syntax error". We might need to fix code using only symbols that appear in the error message. But error message contains "syntax error" letters: s y n t a x e r. We can use those letters? But we have code with @ and #. Maybe we need to remove @ and # and use the error message's letters. For example, use 's' 'y' 'n' 't' 'a' 'x' 'e' 'r'. But that seems odd.

However, instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" contains letters, but no symbols. So we cannot use any special symbols. But we can modify code to not have syntax error by removing @ and #, using only standard syntax. So the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But we need to preserve syntax. That likely works in many languages: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; Might be C-like. But there is no curly braces. That is allowed? In C, if without braces expects single statement. That is okay. So the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
We can output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
