Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have weird syntax: "@" and "#" used maybe as tokens? The error message only says syntax error. The task: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we cannot use knowledge; only the error message. But the error message is just "syntax error". So we have to guess? The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains "syntax error" which includes characters: "s y n t a x e r r o r". But they said use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains letters. The code uses special characters like @ and #. Maybe the syntax error arises because the "@" and "#" are invalid. To fix, maybe remove them. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The else is commented incorrectly. Maybe remove the @ and #. So code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the else part originally had # else b = 2; # maybe they wanted comment? The code had '# else b = 2; #' but that is not correct. If we want comment, we can keep '#', but maybe we need to separate? But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains no special symbols. So we cannot use special symbol. So we must produce code that is syntactically correct in some language. We'll produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That is valid C-like. So output that code block.

But check: maybe we need to also add semicolons. Already there. So final answer: triple backquote, the code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
