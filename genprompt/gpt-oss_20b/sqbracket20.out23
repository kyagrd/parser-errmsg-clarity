Thinking...
The user wants only the fixed code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

There is a syntax error. Likely mismatched brackets. Should be if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ] maybe. The code appears to use brackets [] instead of parentheses. There is an extra closing bracket at the end. The error message just says syntax error, no detail.

We must use only symbols that appear in error message? The error message only "syntax error". So no symbols. We just fix the code.

So likely fix: remove the stray bracket at end. Also wrap else clause in brackets. So:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

That seems balanced. Provide inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
