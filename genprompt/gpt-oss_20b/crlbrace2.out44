Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: code has if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } . There is an extra closing brace. Remove it. Also the else clause: need braces? It could be fine if else without braces: else b = 2; The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the trailing }. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
