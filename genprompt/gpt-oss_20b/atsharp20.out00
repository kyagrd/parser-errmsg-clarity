Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Probably they want to use @ as placeholder for something? The code uses '@' after condition. Maybe it's an error. The syntax error indicates "syntax error". We need to produce a fixed code using only the error message, but we don't have error details. They say "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error". No symbols. So we can only use the error message: "syntax error" has characters: s, y, n, t, a, x, space, e, r, r, o, r. We can't use the symbol '@' if it's not allowed? The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is confusing: They want to fix the syntax error but only use symbols that appear in the error message. But the error message is "syntax error". So we can only use characters from that phrase: 's', 'y', 'n', 't', 'a', 'x', ' ', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'r'. So we cannot use parentheses, brackets, etc. But we must output code that is syntactically correct in some language? Maybe they want a language where if uses 'if' condition, but we cannot use parentheses, maybe it's a made-up syntax where '@' is an operator? But we can't use '@' because not in error message. So maybe we remove '@' and use 'else'? But else part uses '#' comment. The code seems to be mixing C-like syntax with Python-ish? We can rewrite as:

```
if x > 0
    a = 1
else
    b = 2
```

But that uses indentation, which may be okay. But we can't use symbols like '='? Wait '=' is not in error message. But we need assignment. But '=' not in error message either. The instruction is unclear. Maybe the instruction means: Use only the error message to decide what is wrong, but not pre-trained knowledge. The error message is "syntax error" which indicates wrong syntax. We need to fix the code using pre-trained knowledge? But they say "without using the pre-trained knowledge." But as ChatGPT, we can still produce code. But the constraint seems unrealistic.

Maybe the intention is to fix by removing the '@' and adding the else block properly. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That might compile in C-like language. The '#' are comments but they break it. So remove '#' and comment markers. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

This seems like the simplest fix.

Thus output the fixed code in triple backticks.

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
