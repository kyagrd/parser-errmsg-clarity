Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at end. Also else clause missing braces or parentheses? Syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; The else can be followed by a statement, but need braces? Not required. The extra } after else clause. So remove it. So final:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Also maybe need semicolon after if? The current code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; It's fine. Just remove trailing }.

Thus answer: code block with fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
