Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have unmatched braces: The if block has opening brace after condition: `{ a = 1; }`. That's fine. Then else clause: `else b = 2;`. That's okay but else body should be enclosed in braces? Not necessary. However we have an extra `}` at end. Also we might need braces around else to match the else body? But syntax error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means the `}` after else is unexpected because if has closed. So just remove that extra `}`. Also we may need to wrap else body in braces? Not required.

But maybe they want to keep braces? But easiest: remove last '}'. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But some languages require semicolon after else statement? It's fine.

But might need braces around else: `else { b = 2; }` but not necessary. But it's safe to add braces to match style. But the error message is due to stray `}`. So removing it resolves.

Let's output fixed code.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
