Thinking...
We have a user request: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #"

We need to produce only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The user says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge". That means we need to fix the code based solely on the error message, not using prior knowledge? Hmm, this is a trick: they want the solution but say to only use the error message. We have to respond with the corrected code. The code uses C-like syntax but incorrectly uses "@" and "#". It probably should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the original code had comment markers (#). The correct code might be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But that's not valid in many languages. The simplest: remove '@', '#' and else comment. So:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
