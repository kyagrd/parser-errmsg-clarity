Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message is generic "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax using only the error message? The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we only see the error message "syntax error". But we can still use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error". So the only symbol from that is maybe the space? There are no special symbols like ; or parentheses. The only symbol present in the error message is probably the space or maybe the letters. But maybe they want to use the symbol "error"? Not sure.

We need to produce fixed code, but the instruction says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is "syntax error". So we can only use 's', 'y', 'n', 't', 'a', 'x', ' ', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'r'. So we cannot use parentheses? The parentheses appear in the code but not in the error message. We are allowed to change code. The instruction says we can use symbols that appear in the error message if available. But we can also use other symbols? It says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That implies we should use them if we can, but maybe we can use others. However, we can't use pre-trained knowledge. This is tricky.

But perhaps the simplest fix is to change brackets to parentheses:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we used curly braces. That symbol '{' and '}' not in error message. But maybe it's okay.

The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages" So we don't need to produce valid C or Python, just fix syntax. So we can replace brackets with parentheses or curly braces.

Also we need to match brackets. There is an unmatched closing bracket ']' at end. So we need to remove it.

So a simple fix:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But then we need to close the outer bracket? Actually original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The else part had no brackets. So we could put else [ b = 2; ]. Then we need to close final bracket? Wait there is an unmatched ']' at the end. We removed? Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Now brackets match? Let's count: after if, opening bracket '[', then closing ']' after a = 1;. Then else, opening '[', then closing ']' after b = 2;. So total 2 opens 2 closes. That seems syntactically balanced.

Thus the fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

We didn't use any symbol not in error message? Actually we used '[' and ']' which are not in "syntax error". But maybe the instruction allows use of any symbol. It says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." But we can still use others. The minimal requirement is just to produce fixed code.

Thus produce output with triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
