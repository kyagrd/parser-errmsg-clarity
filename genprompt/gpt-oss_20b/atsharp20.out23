Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. They mention syntax of code may be different; use symbols from error message if available. The error message is "syntax error" only, no symbols. We must output only the fixed code. We need to guess what syntax expected: maybe if statements require parentheses, curly braces, or something. The code uses `@` which seems odd. Maybe they intended `:`? But we have to use only symbols appearing in error message? But error message has no symbols except letters, but we cannot add new symbols? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Error message: "syntax error" has letters: s y n t a x e r r o r. So symbols? Only letters. But they say symbols that appear in error message, if available. They might mean characters like `?`. But none. So we can just produce fixed code. We need to guess the intended syntax. Maybe the code is from a language where if statement syntax is like `if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2`. The given code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The `@` might be wrong; maybe they intended `:` to separate condition and body. The `#` might be comment symbol? The code uses semicolons. Could be a pseudo-language. Maybe the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Remove `@` and `#`. Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
