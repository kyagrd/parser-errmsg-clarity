Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we have an extra '}'. The correct code should close the else block properly. The syntax seems to use braces for if body but else body doesn't use braces. We might need to enclose else body in braces or close the if properly.

Original code has `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The extra closing brace at the end. Remove it. But then we need to fix the else syntax? The else body is `b = 2;` which is fine if language allows without braces. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies the else is followed by a '}' because we had else clause with no braces. So we need to put braces around else? But the error indicates that the '}' after else is unexpected because if already closed. So we need to remove the '}'. But maybe we need to add braces around else body: `else { b = 2; }`. That would require adding a '{' after else and a '}' after b = 2;. Then the extra '}' at end is still present? Let's analyze.

We have: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`.

Positions: after `else` we have `b = 2;` then `}`. The else body is not enclosed in braces. So the else clause ends at `b = 2;`. The following `}` is extraneous. So to fix, remove the trailing `}`. The code becomes: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That seems valid if language allows else without braces. But the error message refers to the '}' after else clause. So removing that '}' solves. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The symbols: '}'. So we might keep the '}' but reposition? Or maybe we need to add braces to make it part of else block, so the '}' matches a '{' we add. That would use symbols from error message? The symbol is '}'. But we need to use symbols in error message maybe to indicate solution. But the instruction says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can use the '}' symbol. But we already have it. So we can remove or keep.

Maybe the correct fix is to add a '{' before 'b = 2;' to open a block, and then keep the '}'. That would result: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That uses the '}' symbol. That likely is the correct syntax. So output that. Also we don't need any extra '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Thus output that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
