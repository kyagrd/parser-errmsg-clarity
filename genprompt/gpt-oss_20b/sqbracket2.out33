Thinking...
We need to output fixed code. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax error using only symbols in error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). They want to remove the extraneous ']' after else clause, maybe adjust brackets.

They say syntax may differ from existing languages. We can correct by removing trailing ']' at the end, maybe also correct brackets. The code probably intends to be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But the else is missing brackets. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove that ']' after else clause. Let's rewrite:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need brackets around else block. They say to use symbols that appear in error message. The error message contains ']' and 'else', 'if', etc. We need to correct.

Probably simplest: remove the trailing ']' after else clause and close the if properly. So:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But that introduces another ']' at the end. Wait the error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That suggests there's an extra ']' after else. So we can remove the last ']':

Original: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

We remove final ']': `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`

But the if statement might not be closed properly because of brackets. The else block not in brackets but that's maybe okay. They mention syntax may differ. So I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

That's likely fixed. They ask to use only the error message, but we can use same brackets. Provide fixed code.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
