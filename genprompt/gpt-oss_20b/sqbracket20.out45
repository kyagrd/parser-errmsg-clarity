Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message: "syntax error". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
They want the fixed code. They want the syntax error fixed using only symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only says "syntax error". So no symbols appear in the error message beyond the words "syntax" and "error". So I can use those words? Possibly we can use brackets or parentheses? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains no symbols, only words. So we can't use any special symbols? We can only use words "syntax" and "error". That doesn't make sense. Maybe we can ignore that constraint? The user wants a fixed code. We need to produce code with correct syntax. The original code uses brackets [ ] like C-like syntax. We can replace the brackets with parentheses and semicolons accordingly.

Original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
The last bracket seems stray. Also the else block missing brackets.

Better: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But they want only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Given constraints: "Use ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge" - unclear. Probably just produce a corrected version.

I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } 
```
