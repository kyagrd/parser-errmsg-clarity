Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Probably the syntax error is the @ and # usage. They want to use else clause but placed # comment. We need to remove '# else b = 2; #'.

Also the code seems to have '@ a = 1;' maybe meant 'a = 1;'? The @ may be error. But the error says after else clause. They might have attempted to comment. They used '#' after else. Actually code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. There's no else keyword. So the else clause doesn't exist. The '#' after else clause might be flagged because the else isn't recognized. The error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the parser sees else somewhere maybe after comment? Actually the code doesn't have else. But maybe '#' denotes comment until end-of-line, so else is part of comment. So else isn't parsed. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Maybe the code originally had else, but they used '#' incorrectly. We need to correct.

Simplest: remove @ and # and else. Provide correct code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

But maybe they want to keep # comments. Use comment after line:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;  # else b = 2;
```

But that still has else in comment? The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. So else clause already closed. If we comment else clause, we should remove else. Let's just provide a working code.

We should output ONLY fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's do:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

Check syntax: In many languages like Ruby? The syntax of if uses 'if (x > 0) a = 1;' not typical Ruby. But the question maybe about languages like JavaScript. In JavaScript, we can't use '@' or '#'. So remove them.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

Ok.
...done thinking.

```ruby
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```
