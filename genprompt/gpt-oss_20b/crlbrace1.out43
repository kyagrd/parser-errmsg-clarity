Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }". There is an unexpected '}' after else clause. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we need to remove the extra '}'. Also we need to ensure else clause has braces if not necessary? In C-like languages, else b = 2; is allowed. So just remove the last '}'. The corrected code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; So final code. Output only the fixed code inside triple backquote.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
