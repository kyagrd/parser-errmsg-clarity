Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to use only the error message? It says "syntax error". They also mention using symbols that appear in error message, if available. Error message: "syntax error" doesn't give symbols. So we can use any symbols. We need to produce fixed code in triple backticks. The syntax of the code may be different from existing languages. They used `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Probably the correct syntax is:
`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Maybe missing brackets. The original had mismatched brackets: `[ ]` after if and `]` after else statement but missing opening bracket for else part. So we can fix by adding opening bracket after else and maybe remove trailing `]` at end? Actually original: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The else part is `b = 2; ]`. There's an extra closing bracket. So maybe correct: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Yes that adds opening bracket for else and ensures closing. So output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Return only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
