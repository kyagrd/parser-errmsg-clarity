Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? They say use only error message, no pre-trained knowledge? But we must output fixed code.

Original code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to produce correct syntax. Possibly C-like language? Use braces. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also remove trailing bracket. Provide code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
