Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. The error message says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So the syntax uses 《 and 》 as delimiters for blocks? But the error indicates that after else clause, there's a 》 that is unexpected because the if statement is already closed. So maybe the correct syntax should be: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Because need to enclose else block with same delimiters.

Also maybe need to close the else block. The trailing 》 after else should be a new 》? Wait: The code ends with 》 after b = 2;. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the else clause must have its own delimiters: else 《 b = 2; 》. But we need to close the if with a 》. In the code, the if block is: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》. That seems fine. Then else b = 2; 》. So we need to change to: else 《 b = 2; 》. So the code becomes:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》.

Let's output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
