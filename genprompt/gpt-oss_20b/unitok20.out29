Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

The error message is simply "syntax error". That's it. There's no detail about what caused the syntax error. We have code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems the user wants to fix it, but only using the error message, which is just "syntax error". They also say: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

Symbols in the error message "syntax error": It contains letters, no special symbols. But we can use the symbols that appear in the error message, maybe nothing. They want to only use the error message and not pre-trained knowledge.

We must output only the fixed code in triple backquotes. So we should produce the code with correct syntax. But we must only use the error message to guide us. However, "syntax error" doesn't give us any symbols.

Given the ambiguous instruction, I think the expected answer is to simply replace the symbols 《 and 》 with some known brackets, like {} or parentheses, and add semicolons. So maybe the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instruction "using ONLY the error message" might mean we cannot use knowledge of languages. But we can only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message "syntax error" has no symbols like brackets. So maybe we can't use any special symbols. Then how to fix?

Alternatively, the error message "syntax error" indicates that there's something wrong. The code currently uses Chinese punctuation 《 and 》 for blocks. Maybe we should change those to something else, like parentheses or braces. But the instruction says "symbols that appear in the error message, if available." There are no such symbols. So we cannot use them.

Thus maybe the answer is just the corrected code with no special symbols? But then we cannot use any block syntax.

We might produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That might be syntactically valid in many languages. For example, in C-like languages, `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` is valid. The curly braces are optional for single statements.

Thus we can produce that. It uses only parentheses from the original code, plus semicolons and else. That should be fine.

Therefore, I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wrap in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
