Thinking...
The user wants only the fixed code. The error message: "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax. It seems they use square brackets but misplace. Usually syntax would be something like:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

But there is an extra closing bracket at the end. So remove the last bracket. So corrected:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But still else missing brackets? They used else b = 2; Without brackets. Maybe consistent use of brackets. They used else b = 2; . Could be allowed. But to be safe: else [ b = 2; ]. But original code had else b = 2; . The error was due to an unmatched bracket. So we can simply remove the trailing ']' at end.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Double-check: there's no syntax error in that line. The brackets may not be standard but it's consistent.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
