Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We have mismatched braces: one opening `{` after if, closed after `a=1;`. Then else followed by `b=2;` no braces. Then an extra `}` at end. Also maybe need braces around else block: `{ b = 2; }`. Remove extra closing brace. So fixed: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
That's final. Output only the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
