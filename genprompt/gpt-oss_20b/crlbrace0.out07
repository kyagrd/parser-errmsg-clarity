Thinking...
We have an error message: "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. So we rely on the message "syntax error". But we can't use pre-trained knowledge. However, we can reason about the code: It has mismatched braces: after else there's no block, but there's an extra closing brace. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Remove the stray `}` at end. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's do that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
