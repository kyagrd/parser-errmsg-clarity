Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have `@` instead of `{`? It's like some pseudo language. The syntax might be:

`if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

The error: syntax error. We need to replace `@` with `{` maybe? But they said "use only error message, without using pre-trained knowledge." Hmm.

The error message only says "syntax error". But we need to fix by using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error". That contains "syntax error". Symbols that appear: maybe the words "syntax" and "error". But we can't use them to produce code.

Wait: They want to use only the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. So we can only rely on the error message content, which is "syntax error". There's no symbols. But we can interpret that as we need to use the symbol that appears in error message? There are no symbols. But maybe they mean to use the symbol `@`? The error message may indicate to use the `@` symbol? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe they want to replace `@` with `:`? Not sure.

But maybe the original code uses `#` to comment? The syntax: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` Perhaps the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The `@` might be a placeholder for something like an arrow? Remove it. Also maybe need braces for else: `else` should be separate.

But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we should use only symbols that appear in the error message. The error message contains the words but no symbols. So we might not use any additional symbols. We can only use the words "syntax" and "error"? But those are words, not symbols. The code can use them as identifiers? For example, use variable name `syntax` or `error`? But we cannot modify error message. But we can change code to use words like `syntax` or `error`? That would be weird.

Maybe the simplest fix: replace `@` with `:`. But colon is not in error message.

Maybe we can simply remove the `@` as syntax error symbol. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This might compile if language is like C? It would be `if (x > 0) a = 1;` but else part not properly placed. Should be `else b = 2;`. The `#` comments around else.

Maybe we need to include braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } # else { b = 2; } #
```

But curly braces not in error message. But we can use `(` and `)`? Those are already there.

Wait: The question: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

Thus we cannot use our knowledge about programming languages. We can only use the error message "syntax error". That doesn't give guidance. But maybe they want to interpret that we should change the code so that the error message would become something else? Hard.

Maybe the error message indicates a syntax error at the `@` symbol. So we can replace `@` with something that is a valid symbol in many languages: `:`? But colon not in error message.

Maybe we should simply remove the `@` symbol, because it's not recognized. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Also else part maybe incorrectly commented. But maybe the language uses `#` for comments. So the `else` line is commented out. But we might want to keep else block. But if we keep else, we need to remove the comment markers. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That is correct. So maybe final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the question: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So we output just code.

Thus final answer:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we used no symbols from error message. That's fine. They didn't forbid. They said "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." But we can still use other symbols. It's okay.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
