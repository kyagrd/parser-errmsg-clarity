Thinking...
The task: We have a syntax error. We can only use the error message. But we have the code. We must fix the syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It appears to use some weird angle brackets 《 and 》 instead of braces {}. In many languages, the if syntax expects braces or no braces but semicolons.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

So we need to produce valid syntax. Let's assume it's Java or C-like. Then:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need to ensure the else block is correct. In C-like languages, if statement with a single statement for each branch, semicolons are fine. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But if x > 0 then a = 1; else b = 2; That is valid. Could also use braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Either way. I'll output the code with braces.

Thus final output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
