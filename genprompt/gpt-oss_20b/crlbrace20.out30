Thinking...
We have a user request: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Error message: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. The code syntax may be different from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is "syntax error". Contains words: syntax, error. Symbols that appear? No symbols, just letters. They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is weird: can't use pre-trained knowledge, only error message. But we can reason: there's an unmatched closing brace. The code has a leading `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's one extra `}` at the end. Also, else clause is missing braces; but perhaps not error? But typical languages require braces after else if you don't want single statement. But here else b = 2; is okay if it's a single statement without braces. The main error is the unmatched '}'. So remove the trailing `}`. Also maybe the else part should be enclosed in braces? But likely just remove the extra `}`. Also check if there's a missing `}` after if? Already has closing `}` after block of if. Then after else we don't need a closing `}`. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That's fixed.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's likely what they expect. Use triple backticks. No commentary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
