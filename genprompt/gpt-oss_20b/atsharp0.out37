Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; # . Looks like they attempted a syntax that is not valid. They used '@' instead of 'then' or maybe they wanted to use colon. Also '# else b = 2; #' uses comments incorrectly. In many languages like Python: if x > 0: a = 1 else: b = 2. But they used semicolons and comments. Maybe they want to write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That's typical C-style. The '#' likely comment marks. So fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But we need only code block.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
