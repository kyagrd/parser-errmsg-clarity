Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. We need to remove '#' after else clause? The else clause comment: after 'else b = 2;' there's a '#'. Also '#' after the if statement. Also '@' after if? The code uses '@' maybe a syntax. We need to produce fixed code. The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should use symbols from error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove '#' after else clause. Also maybe the if statement is closed incorrectly. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The '@' might be part of syntax. The error indicates if statement already closed, then '#' after else clause. So maybe need to put else after closing? Could be: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. Remove '#'. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems likely. Output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.
