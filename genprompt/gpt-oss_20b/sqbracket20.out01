Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to output fixed code. The error message only says "syntax error". They instruct: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only has "syntax error". No symbols to use. So we can just fix the code: Use correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But they said note the syntax may be different from existing languages. But we can use braces or brackets. The code originally used brackets: [ ... ]. There's an extra closing bracket at the end: "else b = 2; ]" maybe extra bracket.

So we can fix: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
Remove extra bracket at end and add opening bracket for else.

Thus code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. That seems minimal.

But they say only output the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
