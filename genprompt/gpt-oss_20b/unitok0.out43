Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, but we can interpret code. It's some language? Looks like maybe Chinese brackets 《》 are used. Probably should be replaced with proper syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. So output fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
