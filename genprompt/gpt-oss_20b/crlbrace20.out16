Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code inside triple backquotes. The error is syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There is an extra closing brace at the end. Also the else clause missing braces around statement. To fix: remove extra '}'. Also could add braces to else: `else { b = 2; }`. But we don't have to change semantics. Just fix syntax. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's correct. Ensure no trailing '}'. Provide triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
