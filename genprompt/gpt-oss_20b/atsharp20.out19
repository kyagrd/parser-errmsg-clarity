Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error message is just "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge, but we can guess minimal fix. We might need to remove or replace "@" and "#" which are likely incorrect. Typically syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;. So we replace @ with nothing, remove '#'. So code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems right. Output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
