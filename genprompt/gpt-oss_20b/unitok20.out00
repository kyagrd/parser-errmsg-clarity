Thinking...
The task: We have code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They mention syntax error. Need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error message only says "syntax error" - no details. They want to use symbols that appear in error message, if available. But the error message only says "syntax error", no symbols. So we must attempt to fix the syntax using the symbols present in the code, maybe using the special brackets 《 》 and other characters. The code uses `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. There is an extra closing bracket at end. Let's examine: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The `if` clause uses opening 《, then a = 1; then closing 》. Then `else b = 2; 》`. There's an extra `》` after the else block. Perhaps remove that. Also else clause should be wrapped in brackets or block. Might need braces but they use 《. So we can rewrite:

`if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Or maybe remove the outermost `》`. Let's propose fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But that still has mismatched number of brackets: For each opening 《 we need a closing 》. In the first block we have one opening and one closing. In else block we have one opening and one closing. So okay. There's no extra bracket. Let's double-check: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Good. But the original code had a stray `》` after else block. So we removed it. We also added 《 before else block. That might be okay.

Thus final output: inside triple backticks: code snippet.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
