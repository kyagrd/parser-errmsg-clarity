Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot rely on knowledge of C, but we can use the error message to deduce. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we have code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

We need to fix syntax. The error indicates that there's a stray closing bracket after else clause. So we need to remove the last ]. Also maybe the [ and ] used to delimit blocks. The if part uses [ ... ] ; then else part uses b = 2; maybe no brackets. So remove the last ].

Also there is a semicolon after the else block maybe not needed? The code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

If we remove last ], we get: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; . That seems correct.

Thus output code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
