Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we have an extra '}'. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
The if block is closed by '}'. else clause should be followed by a statement. But the else has no braces. After that we have an extra '}'. The fix: remove the extra '}'. Also need to add braces to else or keep as single statement: else b = 2; That's fine. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
No extra '}'. Should we add braces? Not necessary. But we need to keep syntax correct. The error message indicates '}' after else clause (if already closed). So removing the '}' is sufficient.

Thus output only the fixed code inside triple backquote.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
