Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We have mismatched brackets: after else, missing brackets. Probably should be:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
Also closing bracket at end removed. Provide fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
