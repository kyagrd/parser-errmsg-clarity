Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Language seems like Pascal? The syntax is weird: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` The `@` maybe variable address? And the comment markers `#` maybe comment start. In many languages, `#` starts comment. But inside if statement, after else clause error. The code seems to have a stray `#` after `else b = 2; #`. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the stray '#'.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;` But we need correct syntax maybe with parentheses: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the `@` is weird but okay. So output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe need semicolon after else? Already there.

Thus produce only the fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
