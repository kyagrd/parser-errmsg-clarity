Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We should close correctly. If else block should have braces or else statement should not have extra closing brace. For example:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, else b = 2; is fine but no closing '}'. The code had two closing braces: one after else statement and one at end. So we need to remove the trailing '}'. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` But we might want braces. But error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So fix by removing that '}'. Provide code.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively we can include else block braces: but that also has closing braces. That would be fine.

But the simplest fix is remove trailing brace. Provide code.

Let's produce final answer: triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
