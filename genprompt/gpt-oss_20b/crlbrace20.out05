Thinking...
The user wants: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They give an error message: "syntax error". They say: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." They want to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

So we need to look at code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The code has an extra closing brace '}' at the end. The syntax error is likely due to mismatched braces. So we should remove the last '}'. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But also note that the else syntax is not correct: else must be followed by a statement, but you can't do `else b = 2;` is fine: else b = 2; is a statement. But we might want to enclose it: else { b = 2; } maybe? The code as is: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That's syntactically okay in C/C++? Actually else b = 2; is a statement after else: yes else statement can be any statement, so else b = 2; is okay. The only error is the trailing '}'. So we should output the corrected code.

Also, the error message only says "syntax error". There's no suggestion. So we just remove the stray '}'. Provide output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Ok.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
