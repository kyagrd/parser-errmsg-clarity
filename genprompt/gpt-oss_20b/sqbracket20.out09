Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error in the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We have an if with parentheses, then a bracket starting a block, but uses [ instead of { or something. Also else b = 2; ] has mismatched bracket. So maybe the syntax expects brackets as block delimiters. The error message "syntax error" doesn't give specifics. We can try to match brackets: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. So we add a bracket before else and close after else block.

Thus corrected code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`

Return that inside triple backticks.

But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message just says "syntax error" no symbols. So we can use brackets.

Thus final code: ```if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
