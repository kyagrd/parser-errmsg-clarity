Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error. The code uses wrong angle quotes 《 and 》. We must replace with proper braces or syntax. The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to fix the code.

The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We can interpret that they used some placeholder for code block. We should replace with braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Thus the fixed code inside triple backquotes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Make sure to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
