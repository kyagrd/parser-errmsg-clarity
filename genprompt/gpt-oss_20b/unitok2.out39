Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code uses custom brackets: 《 and 》 as opening and closing, maybe similar to Chinese brackets. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems they used 《 a = 1; 》 as the then block, but after else they used b = 2; 》? There is an extra 》 at end. The else clause should have its own block maybe also in 《》, but they omitted? They put else b = 2; 》 maybe trying to close the else block incorrectly.

The syntax error indicates unexpected '》' after else clause, meaning that the parser sees the closing bracket before else block ended.

To fix: Use consistent brackets: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》.

So final code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Also need to remove trailing 》 after entire statement. So code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

That's likely correct. Output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
