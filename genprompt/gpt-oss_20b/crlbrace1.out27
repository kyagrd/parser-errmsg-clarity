Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There is an extra closing brace after else clause. Also else clause missing braces around statement. The error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove the extra '}'. Also else should have braces or just statement: `else b = 2;`. The whole code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's it. Ensure only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
