Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
It has an extra closing brace at end. Also else without braces? It might be fine but missing braces after else? In many languages you can do else b = 2; but need semicolon? There's else b = 2; maybe okay. The extra } is syntax error. So remove last }.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
