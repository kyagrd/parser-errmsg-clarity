Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error using only error message. They say the code may be different syntax, not necessarily a language. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

It uses square brackets. The error indicates there's an unexpected ']' after else clause, if statement already closed. The else clause is "else b = 2; ]". The ']' at the end is unexpected. Also the if condition encloses with square brackets but likely should be curly braces or something. But we can only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we can use ']', 'unexpected', 'after', 'else', 'clause', 'if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed'. But we cannot introduce new characters that aren't present? Possibly they mean use symbols that appear in error message, so we should only use ']' maybe? Hard to interpret. But maybe we can remove the stray ']' at end. The code would be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that still has mismatched brackets: The if condition uses '(' ')', but then uses '[' and ']'. That might be accepted? But the error message indicates after else clause, there's a stray ']' after else clause. So by removing that stray ']' we fix error. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. But is that valid? In many languages, you'd use curly braces or parentheses. But the prompt says syntax may be different. So we just remove stray bracket.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
