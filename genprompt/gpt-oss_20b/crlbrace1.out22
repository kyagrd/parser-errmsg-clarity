Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So there's an extra '}'. Remove the final '}'. Also else clause needs braces if you want grouping but not mandatory. So corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But it's not usual to not have braces after else; it's valid. Could also add braces: else { b = 2; }. But instruction: "Fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we can't add knowledge, but we can infer from error: unexpected '}' after else clause. So remove that '}'. So final code. Provide only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
