Thinking...
The user: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They provide the error message: "syntax error". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So just provide corrected syntax. We need to guess what language. Looks like C or Java-like but using square brackets incorrectly. The correct syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Also remove stray bracket at end. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems weird: we should only rely on the error message. But we must still produce correct syntax. The user only gave error message "syntax error". So maybe we can guess that the syntax error is due to mismatched brackets. So we fix by replacing square brackets with curly braces. So produce fixed code. Output only the code inside triple backquote code block.

Thus final output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check no stray brackets. This is the final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
