Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only error message "syntax error" but cannot use pre-trained knowledge? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is a bit strange: we only have the error message "syntax error", but presumably we can still analyze the code to fix it. Maybe they want us to correct the code using what the error message implies. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Looks like the code uses wrong brackets "《" and "》" instead of braces or parentheses. Should use curly braces? The correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. So we produce fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
