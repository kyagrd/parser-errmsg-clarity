Thinking...
We have an error: syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to fix syntax. Likely they want to use braces for if/else. Also stray closing bracket at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe they want to keep square brackets but that isn't standard. Standard is braces. The stray ']' at end should be removed. Also the else branch missing braces? Could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.

We output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
