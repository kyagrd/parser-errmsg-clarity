Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, but presumably we can edit the code to be syntactically correct. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Problems: if expects parentheses around condition? In many languages, `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]` uses brackets incorrectly. Should be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also there's an extra closing bracket at end. So corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively if using languages like PHP? But given syntax, likely C-like.

So output the fixed code.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
