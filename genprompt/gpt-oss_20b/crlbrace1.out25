Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

We have code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax. The error says: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has an extra '}' at the end. The else clause also lacks braces, but that's not an error. So just remove the last '}'. The code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We should output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
