Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code uses weird symbols: "《" and "》". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

This is not valid syntax. Probably the intended syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the problem states: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we have only the error message: "syntax error". But the error message is generic. They want to fix the syntax error. We can produce corrected code. Let's output the fixed code inside triple backticks. The language is not specified but seems like C/C++ style. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should keep exactly that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
