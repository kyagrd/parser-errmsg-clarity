Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have an error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the '#' after else clause? But code has no else clause? Actually code has "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" This seems weird: maybe '@' is part of syntax for if? The comment (#) after else? They say "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means the parser expects else, but sees '#'. So the '#' after else is causing error. But we can just remove the '#' after else? However code has "else b = 2;" preceded by '#', but the else keyword is after a '#', not after 'if' block. Actually code: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". There is a '#' before else, which might comment out the else statement? But the error indicates unexpected '#' after else clause, so maybe else is after the 'if' block, but there's a '#' before else: the parser sees '#', then 'else', but expects else after block? Actually "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)" indicates that after the 'if' block, we had a '#' which is not allowed. So we need to remove the '#' that follows the else clause? Wait, let's parse: after the 'if', we have '@ a = 1;' presumably the body. Then there's a '#', then 'else b = 2;', then another '#'. So the '#' after 'else b = 2;' is causing the error: after the else clause, there is a '#' which is unexpected. So we should remove that trailing '#'. But also maybe remove the leading '#'. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the trailing '#' is the problem. So fix: remove the trailing '#', but keep the '#' before else? But that leading '#' might be a comment start; but the syntax is unknown. The question: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains '#', so we can use '#'. They want to keep '#' maybe. But we need to make code syntactically correct.

Let's propose the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

We removed trailing '#'. That should fix error. Let's output that inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
