Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: there's an extra closing brace '}'. The code has an 'if' with braces for the then part: `{ a = 1; }`. Then else b = 2; and then an extra '}'. We need to remove the extra '}'. The syntax: we can close the if with only the if and else. So corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Also check if else clause syntax: Some languages require braces for else too but given style, else b = 2; is okay. So final code: inside triple backticks.

Ensure no other changes. Just removed the last '}'. That should fix.

We should output only code inside triple backticks. No extra text.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
