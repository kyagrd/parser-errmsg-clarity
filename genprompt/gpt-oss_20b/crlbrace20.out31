Thinking...
We have to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see syntax error. There is an extra closing brace at end. Also else block not using braces. If they want a syntax similar to C, we need to wrap else with braces or remove extra bracket.

Given error message only "syntax error", no hint. But they say use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message "syntax error" contains only letters. Might use 'syntax error' symbols? It says "symbols that appear in the error message". There are no symbols except letters. So nothing else.

We just need to correct: remove extra `}` at end. Also maybe add braces for else for consistency. Could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
