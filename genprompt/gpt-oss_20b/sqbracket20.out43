Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquote.

We must not use pre-trained knowledge? Use only error message. But we can still infer: syntax error. We need to correct brackets: should use braces or parentheses. We can change to proper syntax: 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the code uses square brackets. We can use square brackets but need matching. So correct code: 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

Also remove stray closing bracket at end. So final code: 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

Thus output: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ] 
```
