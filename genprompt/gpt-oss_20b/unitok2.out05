Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We have special brackets 《 and 》 used as parentheses? The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the closing bracket 》 after else seems wrong. The else clause should not have closing bracket. Maybe need to remove that final 》. Also need to close the if block? The opening 《 after if is maybe used to open block. The closing 》 after a = 1; should close the if block. Then else clause should be like: else b = 2; 》。 There's an extra 》 after else. So we need to replace the final 》 with nothing? Or with maybe something else? But error says unexpected '》' after else clause. So we remove that final 》.

Also maybe the else clause needs brackets too? But using 》 after else is wrong. Perhaps we need to use 《 after else too? But maybe else does not need brackets if single statement. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But we still have 》 after a = 1; which closes the if block. That seems fine. So final code: same as above. Ensure there's no trailing 》. So output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
