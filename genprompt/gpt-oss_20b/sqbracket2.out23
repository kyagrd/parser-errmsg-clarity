Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct to something that compiles in this syntax. The syntax appears to be using brackets instead of braces. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause. So there's an extra ']' at the end. Also missing braces for else? In the code else part has `b = 2; ]` so there's a stray closing bracket. The correct syntax likely should be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Also we might need a closing bracket for the if statement? The if statement already closed? Actually the if block uses brackets: after condition, opening bracket `[`, then statement `a = 1;`, then closing bracket `]`. That's fine. Else block should start with `[` and end with `]`. The stray ']' at the end was causing error. So remove that. The final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

That seems correct.

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
