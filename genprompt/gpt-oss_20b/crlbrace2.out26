Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at the end. So remove it. Also need to add braces around else? But the error says '}' after else clause, meaning the else clause is closed by }? Wait else b = 2; } -> after else, the code has b = 2; then a closing '}'. The closing '}' is extraneous, as the if block already closed earlier. So simply remove the final '}'. That would make code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe need to add braces around else block: else { b = 2; }? The error message indicates unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). That suggests the parser was expecting else block but found '}'. But else b = 2; } would be parsed as else block of 'b = 2; }'? Let's parse: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } . In many languages, else followed by statement without braces is allowed, so "else b = 2;" is fine, then the trailing '}' is extraneous. The error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So fix: remove last }.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
