Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Looks like wrong brackets. Should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
