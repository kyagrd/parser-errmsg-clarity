Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)

We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's a '#' after else clause? Actually code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. So the code has `@` maybe indicating something like annotation? But the error indicates after else clause, there's a '#', but if statement already closed. So we need to remove the stray '#' maybe? We need to fix the syntax.

Given instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message includes: unexpected '#', after else clause, if statement already closed. So we have a stray '#'. Remove the stray '#'? The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The '#' after the semicolon after `a = 1;` is probably causing the error. We can remove that. Also maybe the `#` after `b = 2;`? But maybe the else clause is commented out incorrectly. We want a valid syntax: maybe `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the `@` maybe is wrong? But instruction says use only the error message symbols. The error message uses `#`, `else`, `if`, `unexpected`. So we can keep `else`. We need to fix the syntax to not have stray '#'.

Thus the fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But maybe we need to close parentheses? Already closed. The `@` might be part of syntax? If it's an annotation, but keep it. So final code block:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We remove the trailing '#' after the `b = 2;` as well? The original code had two '#': one after a=1; and one after b=2;. The error says after else clause (if statement already closed) unexpected '#', which likely refers to the second '#', after else b=2; So we remove both '#'.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
