Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to use ONLY the error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They give an error message "syntax error" and the code. We must output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We should correct the code to valid syntax. Likely JavaScript. The code has an unmatched brace at end. Also else clause syntax: "else b = 2;" should be "else { b = 2; }". So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's ensure there's no trailing brace. That seems correct.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
