Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

They want us to produce the fixed code. The code currently is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace `}` at the end. Also the else statement missing braces. In C-like languages, else can have a single statement without braces. But the current else statement has `b = 2; }`. That last `}` is extra. We need to remove that.

Also the code might need braces around else if we want to keep braces. But simplest fix: remove the stray `}`.

Also the code could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But if we want to keep the braces around else block, we could do:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But error message just says "syntax error". Usually the error would be due to an unmatched '}'.

Thus we can fix by removing the last '}'. Provide the fixed code.

The instructions: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So just output the code. Let's choose the corrected code. The original code uses a single else without braces. But we can also correct by adding braces. But minimal change: remove the stray '}'. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
