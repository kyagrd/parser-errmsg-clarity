Thinking...
We have an error: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. That means we must deduce from syntax what wrong. The code has unmatched closing brace: there's an extra '}' at the end. Also else missing braces. In C-like languages, else statement can be without braces if single statement. But code has else b = 2; which is fine. But the trailing '}' is extra. Also missing semicolon after else? Actually else b = 2; is fine. So we just remove the final '}'. Also maybe parentheses need to close? It's okay. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe else requires braces? Not necessary. So answer.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
