Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error in code. The code given is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. The fix: remove the extraneous closing brace at the end, and make else statement consistent: either put braces around else block or not. In C-like languages, else b = 2; is fine but then there's an extra } at the end. So remove that. Also, the if block currently has braces around a = 1; that's fine. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
