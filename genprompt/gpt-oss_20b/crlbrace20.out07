Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There is an extra closing brace at end. Also else clause missing braces? In many languages else b=2; is okay but parentheses. But syntax error likely due to unmatched braces: there's an opening { after if, closed after 1; but extra } at end. So remove last }. The corrected code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
That's likely. So output only code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
