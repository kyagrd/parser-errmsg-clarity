Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We see unmatched braces. There's an extra '}' at the end. Also else clause missing braces maybe but not required. It could be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Also remove extra closing brace. So correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Probably that's it.

Return only fixed code inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
