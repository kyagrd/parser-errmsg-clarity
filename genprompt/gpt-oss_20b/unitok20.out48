Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, which says "syntax error". No pre-trained knowledge. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only says "syntax error". No symbols. So maybe we cannot use any additional symbols. The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. They use 《 and 》. The syntax error maybe due to missing closing bracket. Let's try to match: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. There's an unmatched 《 before else? Actually we have one 《 before a, and two 》 after a, and another 》 after b=2. So we need to close the if block. Maybe use 《 to open, and 》 to close. Should be: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
