Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. We are told to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
It seems we should close the if properly. Maybe the code uses brackets [] for blocks. So the code originally had an extra closing bracket after else clause. We should remove the trailing ]. So fixed: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
Yes. That should remove error. No other modifications. The instruction: Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
