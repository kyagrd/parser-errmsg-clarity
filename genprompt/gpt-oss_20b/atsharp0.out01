Thinking...
We need to correct the syntax error using only the error message, but no pre-trained knowledge. However, we are ChatGPT with pre-trained knowledge; but instructions: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we cannot rely on our internal knowledge but only use the error message. The error message is "syntax error". That is generic. So we need to guess typical syntax error in this code: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". The error is due to "@" symbol maybe causing syntax error. Also comment lines: # else b = 2; # is invalid in Python, but maybe in some other language? But it's likely C-like. In C, you cannot use "@" either. Also comments should be // or /* */, not #. So the syntax error arises. We need to fix: use "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }" Also remove the hash comments. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

We need to output only the fixed code in triple backticks. So we output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's likely the answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
