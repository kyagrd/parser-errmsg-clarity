Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

They say syntax may be different from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in error message. The error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So they need to remove the stray closing bracket after else clause. Also brackets usage seems unusual: use [ ... ] instead of { ... }. If we keep same style, maybe else clause should have [ ... ]. The code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

Probably should be: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. But need to match the error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means there's an extra ] after else clause, because else clause already closed earlier? Actually the if statement: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ] -> else clause has 'b = 2;' but there is an extra closing bracket ']' at end. So fix: remove the trailing ']' after else clause. But maybe else clause requires brackets? Might be: else [ b = 2; ]. They used else without brackets earlier. But they put else b = 2; but then an extra ]. So correct could be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

But maybe simpler: keep syntax style but remove trailing bracket:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 

But that still has semicolon after else? In many languages, else doesn't need semicolon. But this syntax is non-standard.

Given instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we need to keep the bracket style as used: [ ].

Also "error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we should remove that unexpected ']'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe else clause should also be bracketed: else [ b = 2; ]. The error message says after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies else clause was closed by the ']' before. Actually, after else, they wrote b = 2; ] where ']' closed the else? But else clause didn't open with '['. So the parser expects maybe a block. So we might need to add a '[' before b. So proper syntax: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ].

Thus we add '[' before else block and keep closing ']' after. That uses symbols from error message: brackets. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
