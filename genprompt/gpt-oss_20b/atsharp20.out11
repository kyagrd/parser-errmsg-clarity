Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, which is "syntax error". Not using pre-trained knowledge. But we can still reason about typical syntax errors. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have stray @ and #. Maybe the language uses `@` as annotation? But error indicates syntax error. We can replace `@` with something else? Maybe `@` is invalid, so remove it. Also remove # comment markers? Maybe # is comment but placed incorrectly? The code likely expects: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But we can't use pre-trained knowledge? But we can still produce a plausible syntax: The error message only says syntax error, so we guess the fix: remove the `@` and `#` characters. Provide fixed code.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we have to output only the fixed code block. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
