Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error in the code using only the error message (which is generic). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to correct syntax. Likely intended to use braces {} or parentheses. Should be: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Also there's an extra closing bracket at the end. Remove it. The code is probably C-like.

Thus output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
