Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We have an error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses `@` incorrectly. Probably it's from some templating language? The error suggests that the else clause was closed incorrectly with '#'. The code might be from a script with templating tags like `#` as comment marker, but not sure.

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must rely only on error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means after else clause there's a '#', but else is closed. So we need to remove the '#' after else clause or restructure. The code shows: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There's an `@` after condition. That might be wrong. Actually code might be trying to use `@` to start a code block? In some languages, `@` is an annotation or property. In Ruby, `if x > 0` then ... But here we have `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`. That is wrong. Possibly the code is from "Bash" or "C"? The syntax looks like C-like: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`. In C, there is no `@`. In some templating language like Jinja, `@` may be used to denote something. But we must fix it.

Let's interpret that the code intends to assign a=1 if x>0, else b=2. The correct syntax in C: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The stray '#' are comments? In C, `#` is preprocessor directive. So maybe we want to remove them. The error message says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates that the else clause was closed before '#', but '#' was still there. So remove trailing '#'.

Also the `@` before a is wrong. Remove it.

So fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That is the simplest.

We output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
