Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to adjust braces: There's an extra closing brace after else. The correct syntax might be: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So we should add braces around else statement and remove the extra one at end? Actually the current code has braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's a closing brace after the semicolon of else. So we need to replace that with `{ b = 2; }`. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Thus output the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
