Thinking...
We have to output only the fixed code. We must correct syntax: the error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We see an extra '}' at end. Also missing braces around else block maybe. But error indicates if already closed; we need to remove the stray }.

Thus fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But maybe braces around else: else { b = 2; } optional. But error says '}' after else clause. So remove last '}'. So final: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
That's it.

We output code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
