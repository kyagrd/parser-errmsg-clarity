Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. Error message is "syntax error". We can't use pre-trained knowledge? It says "without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we need to rely solely on error message? That is odd: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." It may imply we must infer from code itself.

Given the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses special characters 《 and 》 instead of braces. The syntax error likely because of those characters. Replace them with braces or correct syntax. Since it's presumably C-like language: should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we also need braces around else block: else { b = 2; }

So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`

Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
