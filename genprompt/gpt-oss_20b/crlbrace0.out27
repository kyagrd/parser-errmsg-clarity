Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is a syntax error. The if statement is missing braces around else part, also an extra closing brace. It should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or we could write:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes. The error message is just "syntax error" with no details. They want to fix it using ONLY the error message. The code should be the fixed code. No other explanation. The output should be only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But I need to match the original formatting? Probably just the code.

Hence:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
