Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Original: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. We have an extra `}` after else clause. Should be: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` or maybe else statement without braces? The code originally had braces for then but not else. The error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the stray '}'. The code becomes `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That seems fine. But maybe we need braces around else too? Not required. The error specifically: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove that '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. Provide inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
