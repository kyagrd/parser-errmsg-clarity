Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We have some special brackets 《 and 》. The error likely due to mismatched brackets or missing else syntax. We must use symbols that appear in the error message; the error message contains only "syntax error" text. So we can only use characters from that message? The message "syntax error" has letters s y n t a x e r r o r. It also contains space. So we can only use those characters? Possibly we can use those characters to fix. The code uses Chinese brackets; maybe should use normal brackets. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use the characters that appear in "syntax error". Those characters: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o, space. So we can only use those to form a correct syntax? But we need to output fixed code inside triple backticks.

We might replace 《 and 》 with s or r? The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The structure likely should be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. But we can't use curly braces, only allowed characters: s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o and space. We can use maybe "if (x > 0) s a = 1; r else b = 2; o"? That doesn't make sense.

Maybe the intention is that the symbols 《 and 》 are being used as brackets but need to be replaced with parentheses or braces. But we can only use symbols from error message. But maybe we can use 's' as opening bracket and 't' as closing? The error message contains 'syntax error', so maybe we can replace 《 with 's' and 》 with 't'? That might produce: if (x > 0) s a = 1; t else b = 2; t. That's nonsense.

Wait maybe the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Means if there are symbols like parentheses, semicolons, etc. But error message has only text, no symbols. So maybe we can not use any symbol from error message? It says "if available." So maybe we don't have any symbols available, so we can't replace. In that case maybe we need to remove 《 and 》 entirely? The code could be: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;. That would be correct in many languages, but missing braces is optional in some languages like C. Actually C requires braces for else? In C, if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; is valid. So we can simply remove the brackets. That uses only allowed characters from original code: we keep if, parentheses, >, etc. That likely fixes syntax error. But we need to maintain Chinese brackets? The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. So we can change to if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;. That removes 《 and 》. That uses only allowed characters: spaces, letters, parentheses, >, =, ;. Those characters appear in original? Yes they appear. That is likely the simplest fix.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Check if any syntax error: If this were Python, the syntax is wrong: Python requires colon after if condition. But given the context, it's likely C-like. So that should work. We'll output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
