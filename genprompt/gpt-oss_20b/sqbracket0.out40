Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. But we just need to output the fixed code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

There are brackets mismatched. Probably use parentheses. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's the corrected code. The output should be inside triple backticks. No other text.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
