Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They give the error message: "syntax error". Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax. The code seems like JavaScript or C-like. There's an extra closing brace at end: `}`. The else clause missing braces. Should be: `else { b = 2; }`. Also remove the stray `}` at end. So code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That is the fixed code. Also we might want to include semicolons. So output inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
