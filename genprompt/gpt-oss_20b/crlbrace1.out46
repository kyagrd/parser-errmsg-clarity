Thinking...
The user asks to fix the syntax error in the code. We must use only the error message, but we can use the code. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has an unmatched closing brace. The correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } That's the fix. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
