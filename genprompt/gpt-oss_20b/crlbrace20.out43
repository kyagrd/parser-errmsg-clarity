Thinking...
We have an error message: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax error. The code appears like C-like. The syntax error likely due to mismatched braces: There's an extra closing brace '}' at end. Also the else clause syntax: should be `else { b = 2; }`. Currently else b = 2; is fine but missing braces optional. But then there's an extra closing brace. So remove last '}'. The code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But that may still be fine. Also if parentheses? The if statement uses parentheses, okay. So final code.

But maybe they want braces around else: not necessary but could be safe. They said using only error message, but we can't use pre-trained knowledge. The error message only says syntax error. We must use symbols that appear in error message. But error message only contains "syntax error". No symbols. So maybe we need to produce the fixed code as best guess. Provide:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Remove extra brace. That is the fixed code.

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
