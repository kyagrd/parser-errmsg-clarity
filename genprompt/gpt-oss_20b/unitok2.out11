Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The symbol '》' maybe used as brackets. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. So there is '》' after else clause. To fix, maybe remove trailing '》' after else. Also maybe close with '》' after the whole if? The error says unexpected '》' after else clause, meaning the '》' after else is invalid. So remove that. Also maybe close the if with '》'? Actually the opening is after if: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. It might expect '》' to close the if block, but after else it's wrong. So we remove the last '》'. The code becomes: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;.

But still there's a '》' after else? No. So final code. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
