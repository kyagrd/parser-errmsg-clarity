Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The error message: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to correct syntax. The code seems like maybe they want a single-line if with else? But the syntax uses '@' instead of ':' or 'then', maybe they wanted to use "if" in C style? But it's Python-like? Let's see: The code uses parentheses, semicolon, '#' comments. Looks like a C/C++ code snippet. In C, if syntax is: if (condition) statement; else statement;. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The '@' is invalid. Also they used '#' as comments maybe from Python? In C, comments are // or /* */. '#' is preprocessor directive. So the syntax error arises at '@'.

We need to fix syntax using only the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. But we can propose replacement: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; maybe also remove '#'.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need also to close statements with semicolons; we have that. So final answer: fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
