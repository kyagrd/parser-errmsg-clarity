Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message is "syntax error". We need to guess the syntax. In many languages, 'if' statement in C-like languages uses parentheses and curly braces. The '@' is wrong. The '#' might comment. So we need to correct: maybe it's Python? In Python, if (x > 0): a = 1 else: b = 2. Use colon and indentation. But they used semicolons. It's ambiguous. But we can produce a corrected code: 
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
Alternatively, for Python:
```
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
Which is correct? The code originally has parentheses, semicolons. That suggests C or JavaScript. But '@' is invalid. '# else b = 2;' is commented out. So likely they want to comment? But we need to fix syntax. I'd produce C-like code: use braces. Use correct if else. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Thus output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
