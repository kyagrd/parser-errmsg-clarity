Thinking...
The user provides code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

They want to fix syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message is generic: "syntax error". We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. We need to fix the syntax. Probably correct structure: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } or use semicolons and braces. So code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The user likely expects that. They said "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." But I can produce the corrected code. Just output the fixed code in triple backquotes. I think that's correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
