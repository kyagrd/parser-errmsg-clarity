Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We have syntax error. Need to fix using only error message, which says "syntax error". No further info. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message? The error message "syntax error" contains letters: s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r. Also space. So we can use those symbols? But maybe just adjust the code to avoid syntax error, using allowed symbols? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we need to modify code to be syntactically correct, using only symbols that appear in "syntax error". The code uses characters: parentheses, @, spaces, a, equals, ;, #. # is not in error message. So maybe we need to remove or replace # with allowed symbols. We cannot use "if" maybe? But "if" uses i and f, not in error message. Maybe the language is like a made-up language that uses @ for "then"? Or it's a syntax error because of @ usage. The error message only says syntax error, so maybe we just need to correct by removing @. Replace with something else? But allowed symbols: s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r. Maybe use "then" or something? Actually "then" uses t,h,e,n; h is not allowed. We can't use h. We could maybe use "then" spelled "then"? No. Maybe we can use "true"? That uses t,r,u,e; u not allowed. Hmm.

Maybe the code is supposed to be something like:
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
But they used @ to separate. And # to comment? They used "# else b = 2; #" to comment out else. Maybe we need to correct by writing proper else statement: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But the code uses @ and # which are wrong. So we can fix to remove them. Use only symbols allowed in error message: maybe we can use parentheses and equals. The code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; is syntactically correct in many languages. So we can output that. But they want to use only symbols that appear in the error message? "syntax error" has s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r. The code includes spaces, parentheses, >, equals, ;. But parentheses and > are not allowed. But the instruction says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That means we can use those symbols if we need. But maybe not mandatory. But we can still use them. There's no requirement that we cannot use other symbols. The instruction is "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That seems like guidance: if we need to use some symbols, we can use those that appear. But we can still use other symbols maybe. But let's think: The simplest fix: replace @ with something else? If the language expects "then" maybe we can replace @ with "then"? But "then" includes h which is not in error message. So maybe replace with "then" if allowed? We can't use h. Maybe use "if" only. Actually typical syntax: if (condition) statement else statement. So we can write: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;. That would be correct. So I'd output that code.

But the code block: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But maybe they want no else part commented. They had # else b = 2; #. So we can just output code without comment.

Thus final answer: 

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We should not output any explanation.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
