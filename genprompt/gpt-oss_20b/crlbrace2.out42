Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see an extra closing brace '}' at end. Also the else clause syntax is wrong: it should be 'else { b = 2; }'. So we need to remove the stray '}'. The else clause currently has no braces. We can either add braces or use correct syntax. The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the '}' after else is unexpected. To fix: remove that extra '}'. But also the else clause currently is 'else b = 2;' which may be allowed in some languages but not in languages with braces required. The prompt says syntax may be different; but they want us to use symbols that appear in error message. We can keep else b = 2; and just remove the final '}'. But that still leaves else without braces. But maybe that's acceptable in this language. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the problem is that after else clause we have '}'. So just remove it. Then code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That is syntactically fine.

Thus output the fixed code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
