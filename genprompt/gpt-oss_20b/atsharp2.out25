Thinking...
We have a code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". It indicates that after the else clause there is a '#' which is unexpected. The code has 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #'. The '@' seems maybe a placeholder for something else, but we need to fix syntax error using only error message. It says unexpected '#' after else clause, meaning the '#' after else is causing error. The else clause is probably 'else b = 2;'. But the '#' is after else? The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The '#' after else might be considered a comment indicator, but error says unexpected '#'. Maybe the syntax expects '#' as comment but it's not allowed after else? Possibly the '#' should be removed. So we can remove the '#' at the end. Also the '@' maybe incorrectly placed. But only using error message? We can use symbols that appear in error message: unexpected '#', else clause, if statement already closed. We can fix by removing '#' after else. Also maybe remove the '#' after if. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. Might need to change '#' to a comment indicator, but it's causing error. The fix likely: remove all '#' characters.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the '@' still seems weird. But maybe it's placeholder for some operator? Without more context, keep '@'.

Thus final code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
