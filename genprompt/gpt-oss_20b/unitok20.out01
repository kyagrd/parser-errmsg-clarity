Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. It uses symbols 《 and 》 like angle brackets? The error says "syntax error". We need to fix using only the error message, but can't use pre-trained knowledge. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message? The error message only says "syntax error". No symbols. But maybe they mean we can only use the error message text? Not sure.

But we need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

We need to change 《 to { or something? But we cannot use symbols not in error message? The error message has no symbols. But we might need to use symbols that appear in the error message? Actually "syntax error" has no symbols. So maybe we should just change to correct syntax using typical symbols: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. But the note says the syntax of code above may be different from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python. So maybe we should keep same style with 《 and 》 but missing closing bracket? Actually code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. There are 3 `》` and 2 `《`. Actually open and close mismatched. Should be: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. So we need to add `《` before else block.

So fix: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`.

Return that code. Use triple backticks.

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
