Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The error message is "syntax error". No details. We must use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains "syntax error". No symbols. We can not add new syntax? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use the words "syntax" and "error"? Or the symbols that appear: space, slash? The message is "syntax error". So we can use 's', 'y', 'n', 't', 'a', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'o', ' ', maybe punctuation? Only spaces. But we need to produce valid code? The code is: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. This is not valid in any language. We need to fix syntax error but using only symbols from the error message? That seems impossible. However maybe we can simply rewrite the code to a valid version using typical syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But that uses characters not in the error message. But the instruction says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." It doesn't say we cannot use other symbols. It says "try". So maybe we can use typical syntax but we can incorporate 'syntax error' characters? Not necessary.

Thus output: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the code originally had `#` comments. We can keep them? But `#` is not comment in C, but maybe it's okay. But we can remove them. Let's output the corrected code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
