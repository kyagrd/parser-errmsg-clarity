Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error says: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We see there's a stray ']' after else clause. Also the syntax uses brackets [ ] as delimiters for blocks instead of braces. The if clause already closed, but there's an extra ']' after else clause. So we should remove that trailing ']' and maybe close the else block properly. The code currently: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. We likely want: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. The error indicates that the if statement is already closed, so after else there should be a block. The syntax uses square brackets for block. So we should wrap else block in [ ]. The stray closing ']' at end should be removed or replaced with closing bracket for else block. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Thus only output the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
