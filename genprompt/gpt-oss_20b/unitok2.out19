Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The code uses weird symbols 《 and 》, and error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The error message indicates that the closing bracket 》 after else clause is unexpected because the if statement is already closed. So perhaps the correct syntax should close the if block before the else? Let's inspect: The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses 《 to open something, 》 to close. But it seems there's an extra 》 after the else. The else clause already closed the if, so the trailing 》 is erroneous. So to fix, we should remove the trailing 》 after the else. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But we must keep the closing 》 for the else block? There is no block after else, just a statement. So we should remove the last 》. So final code: inside triple backquotes. Use same syntax with 《 and 》. So code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Yes. Output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
