Error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)

Code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

They want the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. We should not output thinking. So output just the corrected code. The error is an extra closing brace after the else statement. The code likely intended:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the original else clause had no braces, so we need to add braces around else block? The error says '}' after else clause, if statement already closed. That suggests that there is an extra '}'. In the code, we see 'if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }'. So after else, we have b = 2; then a closing } that is extra. We can just remove the last }.

So fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Alternatively, if we want to preserve braces for else, we could write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the error message only references the extra '}'. So just remove the last '}'. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We should output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
