Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. Original: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra '}'. We need to remove the trailing }.

Also note the syntax may be different. But we just fix by removing the last '}'. So code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Make sure triple backticks.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
