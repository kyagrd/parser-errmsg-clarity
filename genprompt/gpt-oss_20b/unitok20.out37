Thinking...
The user gives an error message: "syntax error". Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The code seems to use unusual brackets: 《 and 》, perhaps intended to be curly braces? But we have to use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message only says "syntax error". We cannot use any knowledge about what the correct syntax should be. However, we can only use the error message. The error message is just "syntax error" - no hints.

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is weird: we cannot use knowledge about the language. But we can use the error message to fix? The error message just says "syntax error". There's no specific line number or token.

We might guess that the problem is the brackets. So we replace 《 with { and 》 with }. But that's using pre-trained knowledge. But maybe allowed? The instruction is ambiguous: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we cannot assume the code is C/Java/Python. But we can use the error message, but it is just "syntax error".

We might interpret that we should keep the same symbols as the error message says. But the error message has no symbols. So maybe we must output the same code? That would not fix. But the user likely expects the fixed code with curly braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But there is also a stray closing 》 after the else? The code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The opening 《 after the condition, then a = 1; then 》, then else b = 2; then 》. The stray closing 》 at end. So we should replace with braces:

`if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` (no trailing brace). That would be correct. So likely the fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We must output only the fixed code in triple backquotes.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
