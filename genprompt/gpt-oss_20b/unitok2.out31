Thinking...
We have code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses 《 and 》 as some brackets. We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The error mentions unexpected '》' after else clause. We need to remove or reposition 》 after else? The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So we have 》 after else clause, maybe closing bracket for the if statement. The else clause shouldn't have a closing bracket after it. So we need to remove that final 》. Also the opening 《 after the condition maybe starts a block. The block is closed by 》 before else. That seems fine. The final 》 after else should be removed. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But we need to be careful: The syntax might require closing after else? But error says after else clause unexpected '》', meaning the parser thinks the if statement is already closed. So remove final 》. So output fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
