Thinking...
We have a code snippet: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error message: syntax error. We need to fix syntax error using only the error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must infer from the error message: syntax error. But they want to fix by using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error" with no symbols. So we can't use symbols from error message. That suggests we need to fix by editing the code to be syntactically correct using only symbols available? Hmm.

We have code with 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #'. There's a stray '@' symbol. Also stray '#' after each statement. We need to produce a code snippet with correct syntax for some language. Since they mention "syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So it's flexible. But we just need to produce a corrected version. Let's choose a simple language-like syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So remove @ and #. Also semicolons maybe okay. Let's output that.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That should be good.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
