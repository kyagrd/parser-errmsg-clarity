Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Syntax error likely due to `@` used incorrectly. Perhaps the language expects `:` after if. Could be like Python? But they said syntax may be different. They ask to use only the error message, which is "syntax error". So we need to replace with something that removes error, maybe remove @ and #. Could be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That seems typical. Use braces. Provide fixed code. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
