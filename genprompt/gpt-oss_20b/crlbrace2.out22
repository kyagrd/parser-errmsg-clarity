Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means there's an extra closing brace after else. The correct code likely: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So we need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Use correct syntax: open brace for else block. Also ensure braces match: `if (...) { ... } else { ... }`. Let's produce that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
