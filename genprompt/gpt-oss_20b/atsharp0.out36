Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error in the code snippet. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
The syntax error message says "syntax error". We must only use the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But presumably we must correct the code. The code seems to be a syntax error because of '@' and '#' used incorrectly. In many languages, '@' and '#' are not valid in this context. In typical C-like syntax, we would write:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But if we want to keep the '#' comments, we could put comment after semicolon. '# else b = 2;' is a comment, but the '#' comment is not valid in C. So this might be Python? In Python, you cannot write `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`. In Python, you write `if x > 0: a = 1`. But given the syntax of `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`, it looks like a C-like syntax but with errors. Use the error message only, we cannot bring knowledge. But we can guess that the fix is to remove the '@' and '#' and correct the else syntax. The code should be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Thus output the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. No other text.

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
