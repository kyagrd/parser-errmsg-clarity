Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. They say: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

Error message: "syntax error". So we can only use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message is "syntax error". That string includes the letters s y n t a x e r r o r. We can't use anything else? It says "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available". So we must construct a fixed code using only symbols that appear in "syntax error". What symbols? The message includes letters and space. So we can use letters s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o, and space, maybe punctuation? No punctuation besides space? It includes the letters s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o and maybe space. No punctuation. So we cannot use parentheses or brackets or semicolons? They are not in error message. But code uses parentheses and brackets, but maybe we can replace with allowed symbols? We can use only letters s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o and space. But we need to output code that compiles? They didn't mention compile. Just syntax error fix. But code originally uses symbols like ( ) [ ] ; . We cannot use them? The instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we should avoid symbols not in error message. So replace parentheses and brackets with letters? But then code wouldn't be valid syntax of any known language. But maybe they just want to remove mismatched brackets. Actually the code has mismatched brackets: after else b = 2; ] there's an extra ]. The if clause uses [ ... ]. That's weird syntax. Might be like a macro? But we can simply remove the extraneous ] at end. Also we might need else part: else b = 2; maybe missing braces? But code uses brackets for if block, else not. We could remove the brackets and use parentheses? But parentheses not allowed by error message? However error message not necessarily restrict symbols. It says "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That is ambiguous.

Probably simplest: fix mismatched bracket: remove the final ]. Also maybe remove the semicolons? But semicolons exist in original. So we can produce:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But still mismatched bracket? The opening bracket is matched with closing bracket after a=1;. That's okay. The final extra ] removed. That would be syntactically correct in a hypothetical language where if uses brackets. The else part no bracket. That might be fine.

So output that.

Let's output fixed code inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
