Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` There's an extra closing brace at the end. The syntax error likely due to unmatched braces. The error message only says "syntax error". We must use only the error message, meaning we cannot use prior knowledge but only the message. But we need to fix. Use symbols in the error message: syntax error. The error message includes words "syntax" and "error". We can't use other knowledge? They say "try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message includes "syntax error". The symbols: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r. But we might ignore that and just fix code by removing the extra '}'. So correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That uses braces. Should we keep braces? The original else b = 2; no braces. But we can add braces. The extra '}' removed. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 
```

But there's no closing brace. If we don't need to close a brace because there is no opening before? Wait original had one opening brace after if, closed after a=1. Then else b=2; then extra '}'. Remove that. So final: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That's the corrected code. That matches language? The else b=2; is acceptable. So final output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
