Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message is "syntax error". So we can only use the error message itself. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to fix syntax error. The error message gives no details. But we are told to only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message contains the words: "syntax" "error". That is the error message. The code uses @, #. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message? That means we cannot use other symbols? This is odd. Maybe the instruction means we can only use symbols that appear in the error message: i.e., maybe the only allowed symbol is the word "syntax" or "error". But that seems impossible.

But maybe the intention: The error message "syntax error" doesn't include any symbols like @ or #. So we cannot use them. But we have to fix the code. The simplest fix: replace '@' with '=' and remove the '# else b = 2; #' or comment syntax. Maybe we can comment out using // or /* but those are not in error message. But we can't use them? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use symbols present in "syntax error". That string includes letters, space. No special symbols. So maybe we cannot use special symbols. But we need to output valid code. But we might use no special symbol; we could write:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But that uses else. But we can't use else because maybe it's fine. The code would be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That has no '@' or '#'. It uses else. That's fine. So the fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
