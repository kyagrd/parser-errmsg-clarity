Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code given:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses brackets `[` and `]` incorrectly; we should use curly braces or no braces. The correct code could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or just:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the error message says unexpected ']' after else clause. That implies that after else clause, there is an extra `]`. So we need to remove that bracket. Also the opening `[` after if is wrong; should be `{`. So the fixed code: use curly braces. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.

Also the last `]` removed. So output only that code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
