Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the '#' after else clause? Actually code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. It looks like comment characters '#'. The language likely Python? In Python, comments start with '#', but here inside if statement. The syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The line has if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. Actually there is 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1;' In Python, '@' is decorator, not valid there. But maybe this is pseudocode? The question says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should only rely on the error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to fix by removing the '#' after else clause? But else clause is not present? Actually comment starts with '# else b = 2; #'. Maybe the parser thinks there is an else after if? Actually the syntax error says: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there was an else clause already closed. The '#' is unexpected after that else clause. So we need to remove the '#' after the else clause. So remove the trailing '#', and maybe also remove the '#' before else. But we need to keep the comment? Or maybe remove all '#' characters? Let's propose the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But still syntax error due to '@'. But the error message only indicates '#' issue. So we only fix that. But code might still have syntax errors due to other parts, but the question only wants to fix the syntax error indicated by error message. So remove the '#' characters: before else and after else. So:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
