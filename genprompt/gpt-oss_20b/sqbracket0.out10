Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The error message just "syntax error". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
This is likely an attempt at C-like syntax but with brackets incorrectly. In many languages like C, if statement uses parentheses and braces {} or no braces with single statement. The code uses square brackets [ ] which is not valid. Also there's an extra closing bracket at end. Should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But the requirement: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems odd: they want us to use the error message only? But we can produce the corrected code. It's likely they want just the corrected code. So output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. So final answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should ensure no extra bracket. Yes.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
