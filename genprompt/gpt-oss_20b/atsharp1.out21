Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause. Code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Looks like the language maybe some pseudo-code? Maybe it's C-style? The syntax "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" looks weird. Usually if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But here there's a stray "@" before a. Also comments (# ...) maybe incorrectly placed. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove '#' after else. The code: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" There is a '#' before else? Actually there's a '# else b = 2; #' so '#' before else maybe part of comment? It seems to be a comment start (#). The code may be Ruby? In Ruby, '#' starts a comment. So after "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" the comment continues to end-of-line, so the else part is commented out causing error. The fix: remove '#' before else. But also maybe remove '@'. But only using error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the error arises due to '#' after else? Wait message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means there is a '#' after else clause. In our code, after else clause there is '#', but there is no else clause; the '#' starts a comment after 'if ...'. The error says after else clause. Maybe actual code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; # . The parser thinks 'else' exists? Hard.

Simplest fix: comment removal. Write proper if-else:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Remove '#' and '@'. But must not use pre-trained knowledge? We can just output fixed code. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe language expects braces. But error message indicates '#' comment is problematic. So removing '#' should solve. I'll output code block.

...done thinking.
