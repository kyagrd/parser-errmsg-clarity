Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code using only error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to produce fixed code. The syntax likely meant to use braces {} instead of square brackets. The closing bracket after else is unexpected. So fix by removing the extraneous ']' and using correct braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But we might also keep minimal change: replace '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'. The else block has no braces originally. The extraneous ']' at end should be removed.

Thus fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But still else block missing braces but that's okay. The error mention else clause already closed, so the final ']' is unexpected. So remove it. But also the '[' should be '{'.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return only the code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
