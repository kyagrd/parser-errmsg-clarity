Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses strange symbols: "《 a = 1; 》" and "》". Probably intended to use brackets like {}? Error message only says syntax error. Use only error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error message has no symbols except "syntax error". The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains only "syntax error" with a space. So we cannot use curly braces. Maybe we can replace 《 with ( and 》 with ). Use parentheses? But the code already has if (x > 0). So maybe we need to replace "《 a = 1; 》" with "a = 1;"? And "》" with something? Let's examine code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We have opening "《" after if condition. And then after a=1; we have " 》". Then after else part we have " 》". There are two closing 》, but only one opening 《. Likely misused delimiters. The error is syntax. We can rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Thus remove special symbols. That should fix. Use only code block. Let's output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
