Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace. Also else branch missing braces. Fix: remove last brace. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe also need braces for else? But the error likely due to stray '}'. So fixed code is with removal of last '}'. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
