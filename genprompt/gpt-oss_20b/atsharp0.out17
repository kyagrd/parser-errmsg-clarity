Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, but we can't use pre-trained knowledge. The error message is generic "syntax error". The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. In many languages, e.g., C-like, `@` is invalid. Maybe the intention was to use `=`? But we need to correct syntax. The code uses `#` for comments? In C, comments are // or /* */. In Python, `#` is comment but code is not Python. Use C syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or maybe it's Pascal? But `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Likely C-like.

Thus fix: remove @, remove #. The code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Output code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
