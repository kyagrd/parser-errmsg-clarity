Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error message: syntax error. They ask: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is weird: they want us to only use the error message? The error message is just "syntax error". So maybe we just guess that the code is invalid due to some weird brackets "《" and "》". We need to produce valid syntax. The original code uses non-standard angle brackets. In Java or C-like languages, it's `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. They want to use only error message to fix? But obviously we need to fix. We'll produce code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also if they want to keep braces, but we might need to separate statement after else. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
