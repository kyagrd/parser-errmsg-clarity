Thinking...
We have an error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses unusual syntax: "《" and "》" to denote block? We need to fix the syntax error. The error indicates that after the else clause, there's an unexpected '》', meaning the else clause is closed incorrectly. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. There's an extra closing bracket '》' at the end. Perhaps the correct syntax: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. We need to use symbols that appear in the error message: unexpected '》' after else clause. So we need to remove the unexpected '》'. Also maybe the if clause should be closed before else, but currently we have 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. After else we need a block. So use 《 b = 2; 》. Also remove trailing '》' after that. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That seems correct. Output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
