Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error message is "syntax error". So we have to use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message contains: "syntax" "error". The characters: s y n t a x e r r o r. The word "syntax error" contains letters: s, y, n, t, a, x, space, e, r, o. But the error message has just the words, no punctuation aside from space. But we can use the word "error" maybe to replace symbols. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We have mismatched brackets: uses '[' and ']' incorrectly. We need to replace them with correct ones: maybe parentheses for block? But we cannot use pre-trained knowledge, only use symbols from the error message. We have only letters, no brackets. But maybe we can keep brackets but close them correctly. We can use 'syntax' as a keyword? But maybe we can use 'if' and 'else' correctly, but we need braces or brackets. But if we cannot use curly braces or parentheses, we need to use maybe 'syntax' or 'error' to represent block. But we might be able to use "syntax" and "error" as placeholder tokens that the language might parse? Not sure.

But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That suggests we can only use characters that appear in the error message. The error message contains letters and a space. So we cannot use '(', ')', '[', ']', ';', etc. But we need them for code. Maybe we can replace them with letters: maybe 'syntax' for parentheses? But the language may not recognize that.

However maybe we can reformat code using only allowed symbols. But we must produce valid syntax? The language is unknown. The original code uses if with parentheses and brackets. We can fix syntax error by replacing square brackets with parentheses, but parentheses are not in error message. So we cannot.

But we can maybe use 'if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2;' using language like Pascal, but uses 'then' and 'else', but 'then' not in error message. This seems not possible.

Maybe we can keep brackets but close them properly: we have an opening '[' after (x > 0). Then we have ']' after a = 1; . So bracket count balanced. Then we have ']' after the else part. That extra ']' causes error. So we just remove the trailing ']' at the end. The code would be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that still uses brackets, but the error message didn't mention those. But we didn't change bracket characters, only removed the extra one. That may be acceptable, as we used only error message? We didn't add new symbols. We only removed one. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That suggests we cannot use additional symbols beyond those in error message? But we didn't add new ones. We used same. But we may still need to ensure code is syntactically correct. If we keep brackets, maybe language still expects braces or parentheses? But we can't know. But maybe the simplest is to remove the trailing ']' which is clearly erroneous.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
