Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error: syntax error. We need to fix syntax using only the error message, meaning we can't bring in prior knowledge? But we need to produce corrected code. The snippet appears to be C-like syntax but uses '@' and '#' incorrectly. Probably intended: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; but maybe comment? The '#' indicates comments in some languages, but using # after code might comment out. Also '@' is not a valid operator. So we need to correct to:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So final output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
