Thinking...
We have error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. The code includes `# else b = 2; #`. Perhaps the syntax expects no '#' after else clause? So we might remove '#' after else clause. Also maybe remove '#' before else? It says after else clause (if statement already closed). We need to correct. So likely we should replace the hash signs with something else? But only using symbols that appear in error message. Error message mentions 'unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)'. We can change the '#' to something else like '//' or '##'? We need to use only symbols from error message: 'unexpected', '#', 'after', 'else', 'clause', 'if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed'. So we can use '#', but maybe replace with something else? But we can only use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message only contains letters, spaces, parentheses, punctuation: 'unexpected', '#', 'after', 'else', 'clause', 'if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed'. So symbols: '#', '(', ')', ',', '.'? There's a comma after 'unexpected' maybe? The message is: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Contains a single quote around '#', parentheses. So symbols we can use: '#', '(', ')', ',' maybe. But we could remove the '#'. The error is unexpected '#' after else clause. So maybe we should replace '#' with a different comment symbol or remove. But the instruction: fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. So we must use only symbols from error message. So we can only use '#', '(', ')', maybe quotes. But we cannot use other punctuation like '@', semicolon, etc? But original code uses '@', semicolon. We might need to keep those. But we can use any character? But "using ONLY the error message" means only use symbols that appear in the error message? Or maybe only use words from the error message? But likely they mean to only use symbols that appear in error message. So we can keep '@' etc? Actually '@' isn't in error message. But maybe we can't use it? But it's original code. We want to fix syntax error. So maybe the '#' is causing error. Remove it. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems correct. The error message indicates '#' after else clause unexpected. So remove both '#' characters. But also maybe remove the one before else. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That uses same syntax. Provide inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
