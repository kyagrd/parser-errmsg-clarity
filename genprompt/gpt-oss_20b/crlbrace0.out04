Thinking...
We have a user request: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So the instruction: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block."

We must use only the error message: "syntax error". So we must fix the code solely based on that error message. But we can't use pre-trained knowledge. We just see that the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax errors. The error message is just "syntax error". So we need to guess where the syntax error is. There's an extra closing brace after else block. The else is missing braces, but still that is allowed: else b = 2; is okay if else block is a single statement. But there's an unmatched opening brace earlier? Let's check:

- if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

We have an opening brace after if: {. Then we close it with } after a = 1;. That is matched. Then else b = 2; then there is an extra closing brace '}'. That is unmatched.

Thus we should remove the extra brace.

Also, maybe the else block should be enclosed in braces but not necessary. But it's fine.

Thus the corrected code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we might also add braces to else: else { b = 2; } but not needed.

But we must output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus final answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Check: It's syntactically correct.

Return only code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
