Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. Error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct the syntax. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause. The if statement is already closed, but there's an extra closing bracket ']' at end.

We should replace the brackets appropriately. The syntax uses [ ] instead of braces. The if block uses [ ... ]. So the code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. There is an extra ] after else clause. So we should remove the trailing ].

Thus fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` But the else clause maybe needs brackets? The syntax may require [ ] for else block too. But we only need to fix the syntax error from the error message. So just remove the last bracket.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Check: after else b=2; no bracket. That's fine. Output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
