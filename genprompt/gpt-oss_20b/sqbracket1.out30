Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error in the code below, using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

We must fix syntax error. The error is due to using square brackets [ ] for block instead of curly braces { } or parentheses. The code seems like it's trying to emulate an if-else statement. The correct syntax in many languages: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But they might want minimal change: change [ to { and ] to }. Let's analyze the original: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. This seems to close with an extra ]. The else clause is not using brackets. The error says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So after else b = 2; we have a ']' which is extra. Also the opening [ after condition is wrong; should be {.

Thus the corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Alternatively if they prefer a single line: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` without brackets. But the syntax error is the brackets. Let's produce minimal change: replace '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'. But there's an extra closing bracket at the end. The original had two closing brackets: one after a=1; and one after else clause. So we need to change the first '[' to '{', the first ']' after a=1; to '}'. Then after else b = 2; we need to replace the final ']' with '}'. So the code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. Wait that would have mismatched braces: opening { after if, closing } after a=1; correct. Then else b = 2; } would close the if block again? Actually else block not enclosed, but then we have an extra } that closes nothing. So we need to also wrap else part with braces. So we can change else b = 2; to else { b = 2; }. That would need to change the final ']' to '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That's correct. So output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Thus answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should output only that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
