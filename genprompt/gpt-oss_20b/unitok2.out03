Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. So we have code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed).

We need to fix syntax using symbols that appear in error message if available. The error message shows unexpected '》' after else clause. So likely the syntax uses '《' and '》' as block delimiters. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The closing '》' after else might be extraneous. The syntax likely expects after else, either a block or statement but not a closing '》' because else is not closed. So remove the final '》' after else. Also need to close the if block properly. The if block uses 《 a = 1; 》, which seems correct. The else block: `else b = 2;` presumably correct. So final code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;` with no final '》'. But maybe the language expects the else block to be enclosed in 《》 as well? But error says unexpected '》' after else clause, meaning after else statement, there was a '》' that shouldn't be there. So remove it. So final code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But maybe the language uses `else 《 b = 2; 》`? However the code originally had else b = 2; 》. So likely the error is the final '》'. So fix is to remove that.

Thus final answer: code block with fixed code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
