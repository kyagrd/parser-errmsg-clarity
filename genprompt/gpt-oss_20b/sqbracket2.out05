Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to remove extra closing bracket at the end? Let's parse: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

It seems they are using brackets [ ] to group statements instead of braces { }. So after else, we have b = 2; and then a stray ]. So we need to remove the final ']' at the end. Also we need to ensure else block has brackets if needed: else [ b = 2; ]? But original has else b = 2; but error says after else clause (if statement already closed). The stray ']' after else is causing error. So fix: remove final ']':

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

However, maybe we need to enclose else block in brackets: else [ b = 2; ]. But error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies else clause incorrectly ended? The else clause should be after ']' of if block; but else has b = 2; no brackets. The final ']' is after else b = 2; . So remove that.

Thus final code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;.

Return inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
