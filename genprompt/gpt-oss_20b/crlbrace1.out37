Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see an extra closing brace after the else clause. The if already closed. Should remove that. Also the else needs braces or just a statement. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we could also write:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

but that might cause implicit grouping. The original had an extra brace, so just remove the last '}'. Let's provide fixed code. The prompt says: Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block. So we respond with:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe better to include braces for else: else { b = 2; }. But the error message indicates unexpected '}' after else clause, so they likely want remove that closing brace. The minimal fix: remove the last '}'. Keep else clause as a single statement. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
