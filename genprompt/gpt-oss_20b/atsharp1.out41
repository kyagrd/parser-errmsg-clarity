Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

We only can use error message. The code has stray `@` after condition? In many languages, `if` expects body: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The code uses `@` incorrectly, and comments `#` incorrectly.

We need produce corrected code. Use typical language maybe JavaScript? Or C? But we need only fixed code inside triple backquotes.

So output: ```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively remove comment. That fixes syntax. Use language maybe JavaScript.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
