Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message just says "syntax error". We need to fix code using symbols from error message? They say "use symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message just says syntax error. The symbols: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r. Actually the words "syntax error" contains letters. We could maybe use those letters in the code to replace brackets? The code uses parentheses, brackets, semicolons. Syntax error likely due to mismatched brackets. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We have parentheses open (x > 0) closed. Then a [ ... ] else b = 2; ] -> mismatched brackets. We can replace [ with ( and ] with ). Let's attempt:

```
if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;
```

But still might have syntax error due to using parentheses for block. In many languages you'd need braces or keywords. But the instruction says syntax may be different. So we can fix bracket mismatch. Also there is an extra closing bracket at end.

So corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Wait that still has brackets. We can close properly: open [ and close ]. But there's only one open. Actually original has [ after if, then ] after a = 1; , then else b = 2; ] extra. So we need to remove the extra bracket at end. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But this uses same bracket set. No error? But the syntax may still error due to using brackets instead of parentheses for block? But instruction says syntax may differ. So likely the intended fix is to remove the stray ']' at the end. So output the fixed code. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.
