Thinking...
We need to output fixed code. The code uses special characters: 《 and 》, maybe they are used like brackets. The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the else clause is incorrectly closed. The syntax: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Probably we need to close the else block with a matching bracket? They used 《 for opening and 》 for closing. The if has opening 《 after condition, then content a = 1; then closing 》. Then else b = 2; 》. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove the final 》. So code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; . That may be the fix. Output that code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
