Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to output only fixed code inside triple backticks. The syntax may differ. Use symbols that appear in error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove trailing ']' after else. Also close if statement properly. It seems they use brackets for block? The original uses [ ... ] to denote block. So the correct should be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But then we need to close the if? The original had an extra closing ']' after else block, but not after the if? In original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We see: after else, b = 2; then closing ']' at end. That is erroneous. Also the else block missing brackets. So correct: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

Thus output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
