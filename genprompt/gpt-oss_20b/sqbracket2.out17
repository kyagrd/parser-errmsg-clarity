Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We need to use only error message; error message says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the problem is that after the else clause, there's an extra closing bracket ']' that is not matched. So remove that last bracket. Also maybe the syntax uses brackets [] instead of braces {}. So the corrected code would be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But note the else clause currently is "else b = 2;" no brackets. The original had an else followed by a statement but no brackets. That might be allowed. The error says after else clause if statement already closed. So the stray ']' should be removed. Also we need to ensure the if statement is properly closed. The if statement has [ a = 1; ] which is closed. Then else b = 2; Then stray ']' should be removed.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Return only that code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
