Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace after else clause. The if statement has `{ a = 1; }` then else part is `b = 2;` but after that there's a `}` which is extra. So fix: remove the extra '}'. The corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we must use ONLY the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message indicates the issue is the extra closing brace. So remove it. That is the answer. Provide only the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
