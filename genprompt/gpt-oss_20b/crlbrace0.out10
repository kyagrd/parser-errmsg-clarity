Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message is "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There are too many braces: opening after if, close after else block maybe, plus an extra closing brace at end. The correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Just that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
