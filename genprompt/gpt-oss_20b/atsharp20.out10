Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

The error message: "syntax error"

The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. We should use only the error message: "syntax error". We must not output any thinking process.

We need to fix the syntax error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error". That contains the words "syntax" and "error". So maybe we can use the word "syntax" or "error" as tokens? The code uses a syntax that is "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". The error likely due to "@" symbol? Also the "# else b = 2; #" is commented incorrectly.

We need to use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message contains letters, but no special symbols. So we can use maybe the word "syntax" or "error" as tokens? Not sure.

The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That implies we should use symbols like "s", "y", "n", "t", "a", "x", "e", "r"? That seems weird.

Maybe we interpret that we can use the word "error" as the statement of the else clause? Or maybe we can use the word "syntax" as a variable name? But we can't use the pre-trained knowledge. We can only use error message. But we can still output fixed code. We can correct the syntax: Replace "@" with "then" or nothing? Maybe "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }" but that uses curly braces not in error message. But we can use symbols: "if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #" still wrong because of "#".

We could maybe replace "#" with "/* ... */"? But again not in error message.

But the instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Since the error message contains only letters, maybe we can use letters like "s", "y", "n", "t", "a", "x", "e", "r". For example, we could replace "@" with "s" maybe? But that seems random.

Perhaps the simplest is to remove the "@". So code becomes:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
But then still the "#" are problematic. But maybe the language uses "#" for comments? In Python, '#' is comment start. But "else b = 2;" would be commented out? Actually "# else b = 2; #" comment starts at '#', so everything after is comment until newline. So the code after comment is only "# else b = 2; #". That is just a comment. So the code is just: "if (x > 0) a = 1;" In many languages, that is syntax error because missing braces or semicolon. But if it's a custom language, maybe it's fine.

We can output:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```
But that still might be syntax error.

Alternatively, we could replace '#' with '//' maybe? But '//' not in error message.

Let's think: The error message "syntax error" might suggest that we need to correct the syntax by using correct punctuation. The '@' symbol is not standard in many languages. So we remove '@'.

Also the semicolons and parentheses may be fine. So final code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
We removed the '#' and '@'. That looks like a standard if statement in many languages (like JavaScript? Actually 'if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;' works in some languages like JavaScript? No, JavaScript requires braces if you have two statements, but you can write: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; That is valid JavaScript? Actually you need braces around the if body if it has multiple statements, but here it's single statements so it is valid. So this is fine.

Thus the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
We should output that in triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
// fixed code
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
