Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge. But we should try to adjust code to satisfy the error message. We have code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

There is an extra closing bracket `]` after else clause. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause. So we need to remove the extra `]`. The corrected code: same with no trailing `]`. So:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe also the closing `]` after the if statement might be unnecessary? Let's see: Code uses `[ ]` to denote blocks. The syntax: if (cond) [ statements ] else [ statements ]? But we see else b = 2; (no brackets). Might be acceptable. But the error message refers to unexpected ']' after else clause, meaning there's a ']' after else clause when else clause already closed. So we remove the trailing `]`. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` Also ensure trailing semicolon after else? It already has. So answer: triple backquote code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
