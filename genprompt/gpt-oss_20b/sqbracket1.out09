Thinking...
We have an error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax. Use only the error message. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means we have stray ']' after else. Also the if uses brackets incorrectly. Should use braces {} or nothing. Let's convert to proper C syntax:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus remove stray brackets. Also there is stray ']' after else b = 2;. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
