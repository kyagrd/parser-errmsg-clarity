Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix the syntax error, using only the error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." This is a somewhat ambiguous instruction. It likely means we only have the error message "syntax error" and no other context. But we are ChatGPT with pre-trained knowledge. But the instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is a strange constraint. But in practice, we just fix the syntax.

The syntax looks like a C-like syntax. Should be: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } But given the code uses brackets [], but mismatched: `[ a = 1; ]` else `b = 2; ]`. It also has an extra closing bracket at the end. So the fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We might also consider that else block doesn't require braces if single statement: else b = 2; But still the mismatched bracket. So I think we replace [ ] with { }. And remove trailing ]. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus answer: just output the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
