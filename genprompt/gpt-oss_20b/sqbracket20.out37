Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Observations: The error message is just "syntax error". The code seems to be a mixture of C-like if, but uses square brackets [ ]. There's an extra closing bracket at end.

We must fix using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we are ChatGPT, we need to produce correct code. The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only contains "syntax error". No symbols there. So we cannot use symbols from the message. So we just need to fix syntax.

We need to produce code inside triple backquotes. The code is likely intended to be like:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

But there's an extra bracket at end.

Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But original had 'else b = 2; ]', missing [ before else. So we need bracket for else.

Also remove trailing ] at end.

So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
