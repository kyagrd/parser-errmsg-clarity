Thinking...
We need to correct syntax error in the code using only error message. Code uses non-ASCII brackets: 《 and 》. They want to replace with parentheses or something? It's Python likely. The original code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. So correct syntax: if x > 0: a = 1 else: b = 2. Or keep semicolons? But Python doesn't use semicolons normally. They used semicolons; okay. But the syntax with brackets must be replaced with parentheses? Use correct parentheses and colon. Eg:

if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But they ask to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. I'll produce minimal fixed code: if (x > 0): a = 1 else: b = 2. However that's not valid either because colon after else? Actually correct: if (x > 0): a = 1 else: b = 2. But Python allows multiple statements on same line using colon? Syntax: if condition: statement else: statement? No, Python's if-else must be separate lines or same line with colon? It's: if condition: statement else: statement is allowed? Let's recall: Python allows if x: a=1 else: b=2 but you need a colon after else: 'if condition: a=1 else: b=2' is invalid. Actually correct syntax: if condition: a=1 else: b=2 is not allowed. Must be:

if condition:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

or single line: if condition: a=1 else: b=2? I think Python 3.8 allows single line 'if condition: a=1 else: b=2' yes you can use a one-liner: 'if condition: a=1 else: b=2' But you need a colon after if, then a statement, then else: b=2. Yes, it's allowed: 'if condition: a=1 else: b=2'. Let's confirm: 'if True: a=1 else: b=2' This is valid? I think not. Let's check memory: Python 3 allows if condition: statement else: statement? Actually the syntax for 'if' statement is: 'if test: suite [elif test: suite]... [else: suite]'. The 'else' is part of the same line? 'if test: statement else: statement' might not be valid. The else clause must be on a new line. But you can use one-liner with semicolons: 'if True: a=1; else: b=2' is invalid. So easiest is multi-line. We'll produce multi-line code.

Thus final code:

```
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

But we need to show triple backticks with code. I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
