Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The else clause is missing braces. Also there is an extra closing brace at end. So correct code: remove extra '}' or add braces. Usually:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

So output code only.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
