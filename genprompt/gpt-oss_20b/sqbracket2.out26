Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra closing bracket ']' at the end. Also syntax seems weird: using brackets [ ] for blocks. So we need to remove the last ']' or match brackets properly.

Given the code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We likely want: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

But the error says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means after the else, there is a ']' but the else hasn't started a block? The syntax seems to use '[' to open block, ']' to close. So we have if condition with [ a = 1; ] and else with b = 2; but the else has no opening [ before b. So either we need to add '[' before else block. Also there is an extra ']' after the else block. So we could fix by adding '[' before b and removing the final ']'.

Thus corrected code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

Return that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
