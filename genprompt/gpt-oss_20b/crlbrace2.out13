Thinking...
The error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra '}' at the end. Also else clause should have braces or else b = 2; but then you close with '}'. Actually the if statement is closed already after else b=2; so the final '}' is extra. So remove final '}'. Also need to ensure else clause syntax: else { b = 2; } or else b = 2; but both fine. The code currently: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } The else clause has no braces. That's okay in many languages if single statement. So just remove trailing }. The fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That seems correct. Provide only fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 
```
