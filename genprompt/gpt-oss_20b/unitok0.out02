Thinking...
The task: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means I can't rely on prior knowledge? But I think I can deduce from the error message: "syntax error" is generic. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
The code uses Chinese angle brackets 《 》 instead of braces { }. That is syntax error. We should replace 《 and 》 with { and }. Also ensure semicolons? The code likely intended:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also maybe missing semicolon after else block? Actually else b = 2; is okay. So fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; But maybe want braces for else as well. But only syntax error was the brackets. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
