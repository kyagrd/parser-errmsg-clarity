Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems like an instruction to fix using only error message, but we can still fix code. The error message is "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax. In C-like languages, if statement uses parentheses for condition and braces for block. The code incorrectly uses brackets. Also there's an extra closing bracket at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe else block requires braces, but can also be single statement without braces. But the code had 'else b = 2; ]' with an unmatched bracket. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But also remove final bracket. Could do:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

I think we should output fixed code with braces. The instruction: Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
