Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in given code using only error message (syntax error). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct syntax. It's a typical if statement in many languages like C or Java. The correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But note that else part missing braces. Also the closing bracket ']' at end is wrong.

So fix: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also need semicolons after assignments.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return only code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
