Thinking...
The user requests: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That instruction seems weird: They want to fix syntax error using only the error message? They likely mean: They have error message "syntax error" and code. They want to provide fixed code. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Use proper syntax.

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
This appears to be a mix of C/Java style with square brackets. The proper syntax in many languages: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Remove extra `]` at end. Also square brackets replaced with braces. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. No other commentary.

So answer: ```if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }```.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
