Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code uses brackets where parentheses are expected. Also an extra closing bracket at the end. We need to fix using only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But presumably we just need to correct the syntax to valid form: use curly braces or parentheses properly.

In C-like syntax, correct would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But if we want to keep single-line with semicolons, it's fine. The error message suggests the else clause had an extra ']' after it. So we should remove the stray bracket and change square brackets to curly braces.

Thus final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we might not need else braces; in C you can do `else b = 2;` but we might want braces. However the original uses brackets: `[ a = 1; ]` etc. So we can just replace with curly braces and remove stray bracket.

Thus final code block: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
