Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? The error message is "syntax error". So we need to infer correct code. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We have extra closing brace after else clause. The else should have braces or not. The correct code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
That matches syntax. So output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
