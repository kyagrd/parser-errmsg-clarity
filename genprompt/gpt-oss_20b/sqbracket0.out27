Thinking...
We have a user asking: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge.

Error message:
syntax error

Code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block."

They want to fix the syntax error. We need to produce only the corrected code inside triple backticks. The original uses square brackets incorrectly for if statement. In C-like syntax, it should be curly braces. The else also missing braces. Also extra closing bracket. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's the fixed code. The error message was just "syntax error". But the instruction "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge" is a bit weird: they want to fix based on error message only? But we are ChatGPT, and we produce fixed code. They specifically say output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote block. So we will output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
