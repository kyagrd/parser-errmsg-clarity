Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra '}' at end. Also else missing braces? The else clause is `else b = 2;` that's fine. We can just remove trailing '}'. So final:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
