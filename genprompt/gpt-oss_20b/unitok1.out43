Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. Error says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). In code, the syntax is messed up: uses 《 and 》 as brackets but wrong. Should use curly braces or nothing. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Need to remove extra '》' at end. So correct code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; Also maybe keep braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } But minimal fix: replace 《 with {, 》 with }, but the last 》 after else should be removed. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause. So final code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; Provide code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
