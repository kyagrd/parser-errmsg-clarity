Thinking...
We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses 《 and 》 for block delimiters maybe. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The error says after else clause, unexpected '》' (if statement already closed). Probably the last 》 is extraneous. So we need to remove the last 》 after else b = 2;. Also maybe need to close with another 》? Wait: Structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. If syntax: 《 marks start of block, 》 marks end of block. For if-else, we want: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. So the second block also needs delimiters. In original, they didn't wrap else block with 《 》. They wrote else b = 2; 》. So the error: unexpected '》' after else clause, because else block not opened. So we should open with 《 before b = 2; and close with 》. So correct code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Also ensure no extraneous 》 at end. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
We output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
