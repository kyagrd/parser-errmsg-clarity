Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The error message is "syntax error". We can't use pre-trained knowledge. But we can interpret that the code is probably in C-like syntax. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

It has an extra closing brace at the end. We need to remove the extra '}'. Also missing braces around else statement maybe? In C, else b = 2; is okay but then there is an extra brace. So correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But still unmatched braces? Count: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; No braces around else, but we have opening { after if, closed } after a=1. That's fine. Then else statement no braces. Then semicolon. That compiles. So we need to remove the trailing '}'. So output fixed code inside triple backquotes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Check no leading/trailing spaces. That should be the final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
