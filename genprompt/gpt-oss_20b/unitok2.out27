Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. The code uses "《" and "》" as some delimiters. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The issue: after else, there's an unexpected '》', meaning that the else clause expects something else, but the code prematurely closed. Probably need to adjust brackets: Maybe the closing delimiter '》' should be after the else statement. So maybe:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But the error says 'if statement already closed'. In the original, after '》', the if is closed, then else. But they also have '》' after b = 2; 》， which is maybe an extra. So maybe the correct syntax is to enclose else block with the delimiters too, not just after.

So final code: ``if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》``

We should not add extra 》 after else block. So final code inside triple backticks: "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》".

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
