Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message "syntax error". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to produce fixed code inside triple backticks. The syntax may be different from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains "syntax error". So no symbols. We must guess a correct syntax. Possibly they expect a valid C-like syntax: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But they mention "the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So maybe the original intended syntax uses square brackets for blocks, but they forgot braces. The code had two brackets: `[ a = 1; ]` is fine but then `else b = 2; ]` has an extra closing bracket at the end. So maybe fix by removing the trailing `]`. So the code would be:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
But maybe they want to close else with brackets too: `else [ b = 2; ]`. The original syntax: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. There's an unmatched `]`. So remove the trailing bracket. Or add a matching opening bracket before else? Actually they used square brackets to enclose the then part. Maybe else part is also in brackets but missing the opening bracket. So the fix could be:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But that would also remove the trailing `]`. That seems plausible. Let's consider the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can't use knowledge about C syntax. We only have the error message "syntax error". That tells us there is a syntax error. We can't see symbols from the error message. So we must guess. The code has an extra bracket. So fix by removing it. That's the simplest. So final answer: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
But we may also need to close else block. But given we can't rely on any knowledge, maybe just remove trailing bracket. I'd output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
