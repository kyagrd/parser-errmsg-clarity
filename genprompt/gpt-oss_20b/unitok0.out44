Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, using only error message? It says "syntax error". We can't use pre-trained knowledge? Probably we can just provide corrected code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It seems using Chinese brackets 《 》 incorrectly. The proper syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

So output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
