Thinking...
We need to correct syntax error. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses weird delimiters 《 and 》. In standard Java/C, we should use braces or semicolons. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to produce fixed code only. They mention "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should only use the error message to determine the fix. The error message says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the extra '》' after else clause. Also likely need to close the if block correctly. We might need braces or semicolons. But we can guess: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; That's standard. So we should remove all 《 and 》. Provide fixed code. Use triple backticks. No other commentary.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
