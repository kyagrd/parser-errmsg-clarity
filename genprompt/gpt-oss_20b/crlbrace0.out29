Thinking...
We have a syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax. The error likely due to mismatched braces: there's an extra closing brace at the end. Also else clause missing braces. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the question says "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we must deduce fix from error message alone? The error message is "syntax error" with no details. But we can use inference. The code has unmatched braces. So we add missing { before else, remove extra } at end. Provide final code in triple backquotes.

Thus final output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

No trailing braces. That's the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
