Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)"

So there's an extra '}' after else clause. The else clause is "b = 2;" but missing braces. The code had: if (...) { a=1; } else b=2; }.

So the syntax error: an unmatched closing brace after else. We should remove that extra '}'. Also else syntax might require braces. But likely the error message is complaining about unexpected '}'. So fix by removing that brace.

Thus fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But maybe else requires braces? In languages like C, else can have a statement. So it's fine: else b = 2; So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But also perhaps we need to enclose else block? But only use error message to fix. So just remove the last '}'. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Yes.

We output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Thus final answer: code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
