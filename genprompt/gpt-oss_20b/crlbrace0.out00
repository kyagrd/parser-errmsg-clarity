Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we still need to produce corrected code. Let's analyze. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Syntax errors: missing opening brace after else, extra closing brace at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also possibly missing semicolons etc. Provided code had semicolons after assignments. Should be fine. So correct code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need output only code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
