Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses if statement with @ and semicolons. Probably language is some like C or PHP? The snippet shows `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The `@` might be some directive. The else clause commented incorrectly. The error says after else clause the '#' after else clause unexpected. So maybe comment syntax is `#`. The code should be:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they had two # at end. So just remove the '#' characters and fix syntax.

But they said using only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message indicates after else clause there is '#', which is unexpected. So we need to remove '#' after else clause. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But also the `@` might be invalid in C. But we assume it's correct for their language. The error is only the '#'. So we output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. No other text.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
