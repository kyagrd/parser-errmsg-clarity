Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace `}` at end. Also missing braces around else? But it's okay: `else b = 2;` is fine if language allows. So remove trailing `}`. Fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. Provide code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 
```
