Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. We have if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So '》' are some special characters maybe replaced by braces? Looks like they are used to open and close blocks. They used 《 and 》 as braces. The else block has 'b = 2; 》' but maybe they forgot opening bracket after else. Should be if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Also need to close with 》 at end. So correct code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. We need only code block. Let's output that.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
