Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The syntax: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

This appears to be perhaps some language like PHP? But they mention '@ a = 1; # else b = 2; #'. Maybe it's Python with comment? The '#' indicates comment. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means that the else is after a closed if. In code, the else part is commented incorrectly.

We want to produce a fixed code that presumably does: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;

But what is '@ a = 1;'? Not sure. Maybe it's a macro or attribute? Could be something like C++ with attribute '[[...]]'? But not.

Alternatively, the code is just incorrectly commented: '# else b = 2; #' should be inside comment, but else is after if. We need to close if before else.

Maybe the code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Remove the '#': that would fix. But the comment '# else b = 2; #' should be removed or replaced.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the '@ a = 1;' still weird. Maybe '@' is annotation. If not, we could ignore. Provide fixed code.

Thus answer: the code block with fixed line.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
