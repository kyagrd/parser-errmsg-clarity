Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the '#' after else clause is unexpected because else already closed. The '#' seems to be a comment marker maybe. The syntax is weird: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Perhaps the correct syntax is `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. The '#' should be removed. Also maybe the `@` is wrong but we can't change because not mentioned. Use only symbols that appear in error message. Error message says unexpected '#', so we remove the '#' after else. Also remove the trailing '#'. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. Output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; 
```
