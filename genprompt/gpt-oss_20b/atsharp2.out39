Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

They say code syntax may be different. There is an if statement, then `@` maybe is block start? The `# else` is erroneous. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, if statement already closed. So we need to remove '#' after else clause or before else? The code currently has `# else b = 2; #`. That seems to be comment markers (#). Maybe they are used as comments but placed incorrectly. We need to use symbols from error message: # maybe needed. But we can just remove the `#` after else clause. So rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the comment markers maybe required? The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, if statement already closed. So we remove the # after else clause, but keep the preceding #? Actually the code has "# else b = 2; #". There are two #. The first # might be comment starting? Maybe the code uses # to comment out the else clause? But it's after else clause? Hard to parse.

Better produce:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the code originally had "@" after condition maybe indicates block? Might need parentheses around block? But we keep same.

Thus output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
