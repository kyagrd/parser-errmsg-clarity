Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Provided error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
The error: after else clause there is an extra closing brace. The code had if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra '}' at the end. Also else clause syntax: else { b = 2; } or else b = 2; is okay but else cannot be followed by a block if we want braces. But we have else b = 2; } . There's an extra closing brace. The correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } maybe. Or if else b = 2; without braces. But the original had a closing brace that wasn't matched. So remove it or add missing open brace? Let's produce corrected code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. Ok.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
