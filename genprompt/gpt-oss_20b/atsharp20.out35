Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There's an `@` before a variable. Probably the error due to `@`. Maybe we should replace `@` with `:` or `==`? The prompt: "using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge." The error message only says "syntax error". It doesn't give specifics. We can guess. The code has weird `@` and `#`. Maybe we should remove `@` and `#`. The statement should be like `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So fix: remove @ and #. Let's produce code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
