Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message? They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is odd: We have to rely solely on error message? The error message is "syntax error". That doesn't give details. But we can deduce likely issues: parentheses/ brackets mismatched. Code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. It has mismatched brackets. In many languages, the if statement uses parentheses for condition, then braces {} for block, else block maybe same. The code uses square brackets which are wrong. Also there's an extra closing square bracket at the end. So fix: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } . Or we can use no braces: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; . But we need to correct syntax. We also need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So final answer: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But we might need to close braces properly. That is correct.

The instructions: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That might be a challenge: We cannot refer to pre-trained knowledge? But we can produce a likely correct code. The error message is only "syntax error". But we can deduce the issue.

We will output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
