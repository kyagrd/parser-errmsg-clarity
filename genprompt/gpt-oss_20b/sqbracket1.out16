Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. Error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We need correct syntax. In many languages like C, it's:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also remove extra bracket at end.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Output only that inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
