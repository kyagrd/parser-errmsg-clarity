Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Observations: There's mismatched brackets. Usually if statement uses parentheses or braces. They used [ ]. That's wrong. Should be braces { }. Also else part missing braces. Also extra closing bracket at end. So correct: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Alternatively if it's C-like, you can write else statement without braces: `else b = 2;`. But the bracket mismatch remains. And there's an extra ']' at end. So we can fix: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But we need balanced brackets. So we can change [ to { and ] to }. But there is an extra ']' at end: maybe a stray bracket. So final: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. This is correct. So output that.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
