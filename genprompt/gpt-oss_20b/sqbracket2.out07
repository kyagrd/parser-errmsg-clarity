Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We have unmatched brackets. They say use only the error message, but can use symbols that appear in the error message. Error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That includes ']' and maybe parentheses, etc. We need to correct code to proper syntax? Use only symbols that appear in error message? So we can use parentheses, brackets, maybe semicolons. The original uses parentheses around condition. They use [ a = 1; ] after if, else clause: else b = 2; ]. There's an extra closing bracket at end. We can remove the extra bracket or replace with something else. Since we need to use symbols that appear in the error message, which includes '(', ')', ']', etc. We can keep parentheses. The error indicates after else clause unexpected ']' - so we should remove that. So code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
But still the ']' after a = 1; seems okay because they used brackets for block. It's not standard but allowed? According to instruction, syntax may differ. So just remove last ']' at end. Provide fixed code.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
