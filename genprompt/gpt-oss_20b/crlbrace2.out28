Thinking...
We have error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see an extra '}' at end. Need to remove it. Also else clause: syntax is `else b = 2;`. Usually you need braces around else block. But maybe the language allows single statement after else. But error indicates if statement already closed. So we should remove the trailing '}'. The fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
