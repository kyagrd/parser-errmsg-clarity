Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So syntax: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

We need to produce code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }? But maybe just remove stray brackets. We can output fixed code.

Given instruction: Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

We must use only error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we can still fix.

The fixed code should likely be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
