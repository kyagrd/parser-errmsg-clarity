Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra closing bracket ']' at the end. Also maybe the opening '[' after if should be maybe '('? But we are to use symbols that appear in error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the final ']' to close else. Also the opening '[' after if might be allowed as start of block; we have to close with ']' after a = 1;? The code shows `[ a = 1; ]`. That part is fine. After else we have `b = 2; ]`. The else part probably needs to be within brackets? But we have no opening '[' for else. So maybe we need to change `b = 2; ]` to `[ b = 2; ]` or just remove the last bracket. But the error is specifically "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests the else clause is closed prematurely? Actually the else clause hasn't got a block. So after else we have `b = 2; ]`. The parser thinks the ']' is closing the else clause but else clause already closed. So we can simply remove the final `]`. Also we might need to wrap else part in brackets for consistency: `[ b = 2; ]`. But the code didn't have opening '[' for else. The error is complaining about ']' after else. So simply removing final ']' should fix. So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That might still have no brackets around else, but that might be fine for this language. The error message indicates that the ']' is unexpected. So we remove it. Provide code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
