Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)"

We need to fix the syntax error. The code seems to have a comment symbol '#' after else clause. But the else clause is not present; it's a comment maybe. The syntax used: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The '@' is weird. It may be a syntax from some language? The instructions say: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we need to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message mentions '#', else clause. So we need to remove the '#' after else clause. Maybe the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But there is no else clause after the @? We need to keep else clause but remove '#'. So maybe the code should be:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the @ might be some syntax for something. It's likely that the code originally intended to use '@' to denote a variable or something. But the error is about '#' after else clause. So we can simply remove the '#' after else clause and after the statement. The code currently:

`if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

We should change to:

`if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`

But there's also a '#' before else which might be considered part of comment. Actually the '#' after the `@ a = 1;` could be starting a comment, but then 'else b = 2;' inside the comment? That might cause syntax error. So to fix, we should remove the '#' that comments out the else. So the else is no longer commented. Also remove trailing '#'.

Thus output only fixed code. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
