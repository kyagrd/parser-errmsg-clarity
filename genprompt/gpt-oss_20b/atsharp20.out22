Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` . Error message just "syntax error". No details. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must only use the error message, which is just "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge. But we can still output the corrected code? They say "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So the error message "syntax error" has symbols? Only letters and space. So we cannot use symbols like parentheses or braces? We can use parentheses? They appear in error message? No. They said try to fix error using symbols that appear in error message, if available. The only symbols in "syntax error" are letters and space. So we cannot use punctuation. But maybe we can use the words "syntax" or "error" in code? That seems weird. They want to fix syntax error using only the error message. Hmm.

We might be forced to produce code that uses only letters and space? The original code uses parentheses, at sign, semicolons, hash, etc. But we can only use symbols that appear in error message: letters and space. That basically means we can only use letters and spaces. But then we cannot compile. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Maybe we can replace problematic symbols with something else that is allowed. We could remove parentheses, at sign, semicolons, hash. We can produce: `if x > 0 a = 1 else b = 2` but that still uses >, which is not allowed. Actually > is not in error message either. Hmm.

Maybe we misinterpret: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we can only rely on the error message to deduce what is wrong. The error message is generic. We must guess. The code has syntax error likely due to stray `@` and `#`. So we should fix by removing `@` and `#`. The correct code might be: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That uses the usual syntax. The instruction: "NOTE the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages" but we can guess. The simplest fix: remove `@` and `#` symbols. That uses same syntax as typical languages. The error message doesn't give specifics. But we can still output fixed code.

Thus final answer: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```
// Fixed code
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
