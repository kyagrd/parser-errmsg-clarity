Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code shows:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses Chinese full-width characters 》 as braces? The error indicates that after else clause the if statement already closed; So the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we only need to fix syntax error using only the error message. So we replace full-width brackets with correct braces. So output only code block.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
