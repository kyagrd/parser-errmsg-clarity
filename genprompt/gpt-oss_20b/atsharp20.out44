Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error message: syntax error. They want to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. We must produce corrected code inside triple backticks. We can only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains "syntax error" – letters, space. So we can only use letters s y n t a x e r r o r? Wait error message is "syntax error" includes letters: s, y, n, t, a, x, space, e, r, o. Also there is maybe punctuation? The message is just "syntax error". So we cannot use parentheses or semicolons? But those symbols appear in the code. We can modify them, but we can only use symbols that appear in the error message? The instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe we can use letters s y n t a x e r o. So we need to rewrite code using only those letters and perhaps digits? The original code uses if, parentheses, etc. But maybe we can write something like "syntax error" as code? Wait: They want to fix syntax error. So produce corrected code. But only use symbols that appear in error message. That seems contradictory. But maybe they mean we can only use the letters that appear in the error message to correct the syntax. For example, we can replace the @ with =? But @ is not in error message. But they said "if available." So we can use symbols that appear in error message if available. But we might not need to replace them.

Let's consider the syntax: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. It's probably in a language that uses if syntax like 'if condition statement'. The '@' maybe indicates something like else. But syntax error arises. We can replace '@' with 'then' or something but 'then' letters t,h,e,n. h not in error message. So can't. We can use 'then' maybe? But h is not in error message. So can't.

Could we use 'if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;' But else uses letters e,l,s. l not in error message. So can't.

We could maybe just remove the else part, to get: 'if (x > 0) a = 1;' That would compile? But the language maybe expects 'if' statement. Without else is fine.

But we need to use only symbols that appear in error message? That might be too restrictive. But maybe we can still produce code with 'if (x > 0) a = 1;' Because that uses 'if', parentheses, >, =. > is not in error message. So can't. But maybe we can just produce "syntax error" as code? That seems nonsense.

I think the instruction "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available" is to encourage using the available characters to fix. But we might not be constrained.

Let's consider we can produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That removes the @ and #. That would likely fix syntax error. But we used else. So else is okay. But else uses l. But maybe that's fine.

Thus output fixed code inside triple backticks:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's deliver.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
