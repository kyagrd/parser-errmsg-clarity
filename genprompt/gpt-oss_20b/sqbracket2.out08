Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to produce fixed code. Use only symbols that appear in error message, i.e., ']' and maybe else clause? It says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the syntax likely uses brackets [ ] for blocks. The original code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The last ']' after else statement is extra. Remove it. Also maybe need to wrap else block in [ ]? But error message says after else clause if already closed. So simply remove the trailing ]. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But the else block not in brackets. The language may allow else with single statement without brackets. So final fixed code: same.

We must output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's produce that.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 
```
