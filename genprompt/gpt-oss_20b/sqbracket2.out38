Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only the error message. Error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to adjust brackets. The syntax maybe like some custom language that uses brackets for blocks. The error says there's an unexpected ']' after else clause. There is an extra ']' at the end. Also maybe the else clause missing brackets. It says if statement already closed. So we need to close properly. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That implies we need to remove the trailing ']' and perhaps adjust else block to use brackets.

Given we can use symbols that appear in error message: ']', 'else', 'if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed', 'unexpected'.

We likely need to rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Thus removing the trailing ']' and adding brackets around else block. That would fix error.

Thus output only the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
