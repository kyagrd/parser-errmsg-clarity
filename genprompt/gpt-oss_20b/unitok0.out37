Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. They show code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The weird brackets. Need correct syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Also note that code block: Should output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

Thus final answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also ensure proper code block formatting.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
