Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the syntax likely expects `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` or simply `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

The error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the '》' after else clause indicates after else we had 'b = 2;' then '》' which is wrong. The correct would remove the '》'.

Thus the fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or with braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

We should rely on the error message. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause. So we should remove the unexpected character. Also we may need to close the if properly. The original had 《 after if condition, which is not valid. Probably we should replace those angled brackets with braces.

Thus the output: code with correct syntax. Probably:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That uses semicolons. That's enough.

Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
