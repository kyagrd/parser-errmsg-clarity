Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see there's an extra closing brace at end. The if statement has opening { after condition, closing } before else, then else b = 2; then an extra }. So remove the last }.

Also else needs braces if multiple statements, but only single statement. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's it.

Return only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
