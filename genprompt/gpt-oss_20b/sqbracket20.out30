Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output the fixed code. The note says syntax of the code above may be different from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in error message, if available. Error message: "syntax error". Only error message, we have no knowledge. But we must fix by using symbols that appear in error message? The error message is just "syntax error". That contains characters: s y n t a x e r r o r. So we can use those symbols: letters. We can maybe change brackets. Perhaps the syntax error is mismatched brackets. The code uses parentheses for condition, then '[' instead of '{', then ']' and an extra ']' at end. Maybe we should replace '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'. But we can't use '{' or '}'? They are not in error message. But the instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That might mean we can use characters from "syntax error": letters only. So maybe we can use parentheses and semicolons. We cannot use '{' or '}'. But we can use '[' and ']'? They are not in error message. But maybe we can keep them if needed. However the code has mismatched brackets: one '[' opens, one ']' closes, then ']' extra. Also else missing brackets.

We could restructure as:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Now brackets matched. We still have mismatch? If we have two '[' and two ']' it's fine. That might fix syntax error.

Also the code ends with ']' after else. In original: `]` after else b = 2; ]. We remove the last bracket. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But we have parentheses for if condition. Might need to close else with bracket. That's fine. We should remove trailing bracket. So output that. The code uses only letters, parentheses, brackets, semicolons. All characters are in "syntax error"? We have parentheses '(' ')' which are not in error message. But maybe not needed to restrict.

The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That implies we should use symbols from "syntax error" maybe not mandatory. But we can produce a plausible syntax fix. We'll output as code block.

Let's output.

...done thinking.
