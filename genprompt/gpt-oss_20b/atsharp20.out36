Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, but we can interpret. Error message: syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Looks like `@` is wrong, and `#` comments? Use symbols from error message? Not sure. We need to produce corrected code. Likely change `@` to `:`? Or maybe the syntax uses `@` as a special operator? But syntax error means wrong operator. Replace `@` with `:` or `=`? Actually typical if syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So replace `@` with nothing: `if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #` but else commented out. Maybe they want to remove `#` comments too. But they said use symbols that appear in error message if available. Error message only says "syntax error" no symbols. So we can arbitrarily use symbols that appear in error message: none. But they said try to fix using symbols that appear in error message, if available. So none available. So we just fix code logically.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

But need to remove the erroneous @ and perhaps # if not needed. Maybe final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Provide that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
