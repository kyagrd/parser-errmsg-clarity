Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Syntax error. We have mismatched brackets: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

The error message is just "syntax error" but we are told: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only says syntax error, no symbols. But we can fix by replacing brackets with parentheses or braces.

We can output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we must use the same syntax? It says note the syntax may be different from existing languages. We can use [ ] as block delimiters? The code uses [ ... ] to group statements. But there's a mismatched bracket at the end. The correct would be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Also remove the trailing ].

Thus code should be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Yes that seems simpler: just replace last ']' with ']' after b = 2; to match opening '[' after else.

But the original had an extra trailing ']' at end. So fix by removing trailing ']' and adding missing '[' after else.

Thus final:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only code. Use triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
