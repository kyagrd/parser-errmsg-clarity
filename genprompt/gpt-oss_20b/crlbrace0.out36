Thinking...
We are told: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must rely only on the error message "syntax error" to fix code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix the syntax error. We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote.

But we can't use pre-trained knowledge, only error message. However we are an AI that has pre-trained knowledge. But instructions say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That might be to simulate using the error message to deduce the problem. But we still can produce correct code. But we should rely on the error message. The code has mismatched braces. The if block uses braces { }, else has no braces, and there's an extra closing brace at the end. We need to fix.

Proper code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or we could add braces around else.

Alternatively we could remove extra brace. The error arises due to unmatched braces: there are 2 opening braces and 3 closing braces? Let's count: after if: '{' then '}' after a = 1. After else: 'b = 2;' then ';' then '}'. So there is one opening after if, and one closing after a. Then there is another closing at end. So we need to remove the last closing brace or add opening before else. But the easiest fix: remove the last '}'.

But the code might be in some language requiring else to be in braces? But we can just do else { b = 2; } or else b = 2; No closing brace needed. The code originally had one opening brace and two closing braces: mismatched. So remove last closing brace.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

However we also might need braces after else if language like C expects braces or not. In C or C++ else without braces is allowed. So we could just remove last closing brace.

Hence final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe they want braces for else as best practice. But no error originally. The error message says "syntax error" maybe due to missing else block braces? But if we just remove the last brace, syntax is fine. So output only the fixed code. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Ok.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
