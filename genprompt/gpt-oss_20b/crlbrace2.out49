Thinking...
We have to output only fixed code inside triple backquote code block. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)

We need to fix using only error message, but basically we need to remove the extra '}'. Let's examine the code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` There's an extra closing brace at end. The correct should be: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` or perhaps the else block should have braces. But given syntax maybe braces optional? But we can fix by adding braces to else, and remove trailing brace. Wait: The code has a trailing '}'. The else clause is `else b = 2;` which is okay if else doesn't need braces. But the trailing '}' after that is unexpected. We can remove it. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`

But they might want braces for else as well. But the error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means the '}' after else is unexpected because else clause already closed. So just remove it.

Thus output: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that inside triple backquote.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
