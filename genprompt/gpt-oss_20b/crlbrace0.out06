Thinking...
We have an error syntax. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace. Also else clause missing braces. Should be: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Also need to ensure proper semicolons. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
