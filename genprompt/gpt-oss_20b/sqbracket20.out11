Thinking...
We have a code snippet: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

Syntax error: mismatched brackets. Perhaps should be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But we are told that syntax may differ from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in the error message. Error message: "syntax error". It doesn't contain specific symbols. But we can guess the correct syntax is to use parentheses or curly braces. The code uses square brackets. Maybe the intended syntax is `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Also there is an extra closing bracket at end. So fix: remove trailing `]` and add one before else: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
