Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have a syntax error. We need to output the fixed code inside triple backquotes. We must not use any pre-trained knowledge. Use only the error message, but we can use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error". We can't use any other knowledge, but we can guess.

We need to fix the syntax: maybe remove the '@' and '#' characters. Use a correct if statement: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; or something. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message has only "syntax error", no symbols. So we can't use that. So we can just fix the code by using correct syntax. So we produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Probably the language uses parentheses for if. So that's the fixed code.

Thus output triple backticks with that line.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
