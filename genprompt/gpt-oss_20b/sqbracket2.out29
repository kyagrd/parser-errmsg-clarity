Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed).

We need to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. So we only can use symbols that appear in the error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So error message contains characters: 'unexpected', ']', 'after', 'else', 'clause', '(', 'if', 'statement', 'already', 'closed'. We can use these symbols: [, ], (, ), and letters? But "symbols" likely refer to punctuation symbols: brackets. The error message contains ']' as symbol, also '(' and ')', maybe ']' again. It also has 'if', 'else', but those are words. The code's syntax may differ from existing languages. We should fix by removing the stray ']' after else clause and possibly closing the else correctly. The code uses [ and ]. The structure: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The else is followed by "b = 2;" but then an extra ']' at end. We need to close the else statement's block properly. Perhaps we should replace the last ']' with a ';' or remove it.

But we are constrained to use only symbols appearing in error message. Error message contains ']' and '(' and ')' and maybe ';'? It doesn't mention ';'. But we can use '[' or ']' or '(' or ')' only. So we should maybe replace the stray ']' at the end with ']'? It's already a ']' but the error says unexpected ']' after else clause. So maybe we need to remove that ']' entirely. So the fixed code could be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that uses ';' which is not mentioned in error message but it's present in code. But error message didn't mention ';' but that's okay maybe we can use it. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we should use ']' if needed. But we can remove the last ']' and keep rest. So the fixed code would be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But the else clause still missing braces? But maybe this syntax uses [] as block, and no braces needed. So this should be fine.

Thus output the fixed code inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
