Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code uses some wrong characters. The code shows:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code likely intended to be something like:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the brackets `《` and `》` are wrong. We should replace them with `{}` maybe? But typical C syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; That's correct. We should output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they might want curly braces. But if using braces, it's:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But given the error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we just need to replace `《` and `》` with `{` and `}`.

Thus final output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
