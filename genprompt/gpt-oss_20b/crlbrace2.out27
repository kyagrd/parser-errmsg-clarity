Thinking...
We have error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at the end. The if statement is closed after the else clause's statement: `else b = 2;` The final `}` is unnecessary.

So remove the final `}`.

Hence:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's the fixed code. Provide inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
