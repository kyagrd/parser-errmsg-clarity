Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must use the error message to figure out what the error is. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We see that there is an extra closing brace at the end. The if statement opens a brace after the condition, then the else part should not have a brace. But the code ends with `}` that is not matched. So we remove that trailing `}`. So the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But maybe also we need to add braces around else? But the else clause does not need braces. It's fine. The error is the stray '}'. So we remove it. That fixes the syntax.

Thus the output: triple backticks with the fixed code.

Thus: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
