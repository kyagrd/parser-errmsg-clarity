Thinking...
The prompt says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." But we have the code. The error message says: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the error is that after the else clause, there's a stray closing bracket. Also there may be a missing opening bracket before else.

Code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to produce fixed code inside triple backticks.

The syntax of the code may be different from existing languages. We need to use symbols that appear in the error message if available. The error message mentions ']' and else. We might fix by removing the stray bracket after else and also adjust the bracket usage.

In the code, we have if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Probably the intended syntax uses brackets around the if body. So we should close the if body with ']' and after else we might want to put brackets around the else body, like [ b = 2; ]. Then we shouldn't have an extra closing ']' after the else.

Thus fixed code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`

Let's output that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
