Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code given:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Issue: The if statement has both then and else parts. Then there's an extra closing brace '}' after else block. The else block has no braces but ends with a semicolon; then there's a stray '}'. Also missing braces for else. Also possibly the else block is missing braces, but the stray '}' is the problem.

We should produce code with correct syntax. So we remove stray '}' and maybe add braces for else. Option: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
That should compile. The original had else b = 2; with no braces. That's allowed, but then stray '}'. But we can keep else without braces: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But we still need to close the if? Actually the 'if' is closed with '}'. So we don't need an extra '}'. So we just remove the last '}'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we also might need braces for else? It's optional if only one statement. But the else statement is "b = 2;" with semicolon. That's fine. So we can just remove '}'. But the if already closed. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But the problem is that the 'else' part may need braces? Not necessary.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But some languages require braces after else if you have multiple statements. It's not the case.

Thus final answer: code block with fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
