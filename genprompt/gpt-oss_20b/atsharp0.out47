Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. This looks like C-like. The `@` is not valid. Probably should be `:`? But typical C `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Also comments with #? In C, comment is // or /* */, not #. So we can remove #. So final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That's it.

We should output ONLY the fixed code in triple backquotes. So: 

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
