Thinking...
The user requests: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block. Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. DO NOT output your thinking process. ONLY output what was asked.

So we need to produce a corrected code snippet. The original uses some non-standard symbols: 《 and 》. It appears they are used like parentheses? The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That suggests that the closing 》 after else is not expected because the if statement was already closed with 》 earlier. So maybe we need to close the if properly. The code likely should be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But the error says after else clause, there is a 》 that is unexpected because the if is already closed. That means we need to remove that extra 》 after else. But maybe we need to add an opening bracket for else part. The original else b = 2; 》 has 》 at the end but no opening 《. So we should add 《 before b = 2. So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. That seems correct.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Given instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message uses '》', so we keep them. The output code block should contain the fixed code. No extra commentary. So final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
