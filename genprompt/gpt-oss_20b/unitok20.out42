Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
There is use of 《 and 》 and maybe an extra 》. Likely correct syntax would use curly braces or parentheses. But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message just says "syntax error". We don't have symbols. But we can attempt to replace 《 and 》 with parentheses or braces. But maybe the language uses 《 and 》 as block delimiters? But they appear mismatched: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The last 》 might be extraneous. So fix: remove last 》. Also use braces? However the code uses 《 to open block and 》 to close. So maybe we just remove the extra closing bracket: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;`. That would be correct. Provide code.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But we need to ensure there is no trailing characters. Provide code.

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
