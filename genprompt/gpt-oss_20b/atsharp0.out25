Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to correct syntax using only the error message (syntax error). We can't rely on pre-trained knowledge? Actually we need to fix syntax. The code seems like a pseudo-code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. Possibly they intend to use some language like JavaScript or C. The error: syntax error. We need to produce correct code.

Maybe the original code had '@' instead of ':', and '#' comments incorrectly placed. We can correct by replacing '@' with ':', remove '#' comment markers or comment correctly.

But we can only use the error message? "syntax error" indicates a syntax error. We need to produce corrected code. Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We also can add comments properly: `//` or `/* */`. They used '#' which is not correct for C-like languages. Use `//` comments. But they might be using a language like Python: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. In Python, parentheses around condition is okay but not needed. Python uses no semicolons typically. They used '@', maybe it's a decorator incorrectly. So best guess: correct code in JavaScript or C-like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Add comments after: `// else b = 2`. Actually the else part is commented incorrectly. We want to keep the logic: if x>0 then a=1 else b=2. So we can correct:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they had a comment around else. Provide minimal syntax error fix. So final output: code block with corrected code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
