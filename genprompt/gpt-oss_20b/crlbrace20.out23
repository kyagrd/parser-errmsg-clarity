Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in the code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output the fixed code inside triple backticks. The syntax may be similar to C-like. The error is syntax error. The code has mismatched braces: there's an extra '}' at the end. Also the else part missing braces: else b = 2; but it's okay in C if you don't use braces. But you have else b = 2; } => there is an extra closing brace after the statement. Remove that.

So corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe need parentheses? In many languages else must be a statement. It's okay. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But the code might need braces for else: else { b = 2; }. But that's optional. The simplest is to remove the trailing '}'. The error message is generic. The prompt says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message just says "syntax error". So can't use any symbol from it. Just fix. So output the corrected code inside triple backticks.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
