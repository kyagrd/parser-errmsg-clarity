Thinking...
We have code with syntax errors. We need to fix using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. But as ChatGPT we can produce solution. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The issue is extra bracket after else? The code uses square brackets instead of parentheses? In many languages like C, square brackets are for arrays, not for grouping. But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we need to adjust only what is indicated: there is an unexpected ']' after else clause. So likely remove the trailing bracket after else or replace with something else. Also correct the use of square brackets. Probably want:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means the parser thought the if was closed before encountering ']' after else. So need to remove that ']' after else or maybe close properly. So minimal change: remove the extra ']' at end. And maybe use parentheses? The code inside uses square brackets for grouping? The syntax could be like:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that extra ']' after else b = 2; is causing error. So we can change to:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ];
```

But that uses bracket after else but need bracket open before. Actually else [ b = 2; ] but we need opening '[' after else. So we change code: `else [ b = 2; ]`. But the original had no opening '[' for else. So we add opening '[' before b = 2; and close after. That would fix the syntax. But also the if part has square brackets around a = 1; but maybe that is okay? The error is about unexpected ']' after else clause. So adding opening '[' before b would match. Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Now we have matching brackets. But maybe we need semicolon after closing bracket? Not necessary. Might be fine. So output fixed code inside triple backquotes. Use the minimal changes. The instruction says "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message". So we only rely on error: unexpected ']' after else clause. So we fix by adding missing '[' before else. The code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
