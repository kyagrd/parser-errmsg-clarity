Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The error is syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. Let's analyze.

- There's an extra closing brace `}` at end. Also the `else` syntax: should be `else { b = 2; }` or `else b = 2;` is valid but missing braces? Actually in many languages like JavaScript or C, `else b = 2;` is valid if you don't need braces; but the `else` part can't be just a single statement? In C, you can do `else b = 2;` is fine. But the error might be the unmatched curly brace: one opening `{` after `if`, closed after `a = 1;`. Then else part has no braces. The code ends with an extra `}`. So fix by removing the last `}`. Also maybe need to add braces around else? But it's optional. The error message is generic "syntax error" maybe due to stray `}`. So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` That's it.

We are to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
