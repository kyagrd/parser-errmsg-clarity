Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. The code uses incorrect brackets. The correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } Probably use curly braces. Output only fixed code in triple backticks.

But instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot rely on pre-trained knowledge? But we need to produce correct code anyway. The error message just says syntax error. We need to produce fixed code. It's ambiguous. But typical answer: use curly braces.

So output:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe the code originally had 《 and 》 as some unusual characters. So we replace them with curly braces. So final answer: triple backticks containing the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
