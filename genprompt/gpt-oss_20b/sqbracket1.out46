Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We must fix. The syntax: typical C/Java/JavaScript uses braces { }, not brackets. So we need to replace [ ] with {} and adjust. Also the final ']' after else should be removed. So correct code: 

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, we could keep else body on single line without braces: `else b = 2;`. But original used brackets. So fix: replace [ with { and ] with }. Also remove trailing ]. So final.

We should output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
