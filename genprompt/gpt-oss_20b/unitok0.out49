Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. The code given:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It appears they used special brackets 《》 instead of parentheses or braces. The correct syntax in many languages: maybe C-like: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or maybe they want to preserve formatting? The error message only says "syntax error". We must use ONLY the error message, not pre-trained knowledge? Means we must not rely on internal knowledge but deduce from error message? But it's too vague. But we can still produce plausible code.

Given the code uses parentheses for condition, but uses Chinese brackets for body and else block. Should replace with curly braces or no braces. But typical syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. Actually else block must have braces if multiple statements. But we have only one statement, so we could use `else b = 2;`. So we need to fix the syntax error by replacing 《》 with `{}` and adding semicolon after else? Wait we already have semicolon after `b = 2;`. But else block may need braces if else part has multiple statements. For single statement, okay.

But the original had two sets of 《》: one around `a = 1;` and one at end. So we need to close else block. The last `》` maybe intended to close else block? It is after `b = 2; 》`. So they closed after else. So we should replace with curly braces: after `a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That will compile.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
