Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error, using ONLY the error message (just "syntax error") and no pre-trained knowledge. They want output only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So we need to provide corrected code.

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to correct syntax. The angle brackets used incorrectly: Chinese angle brackets 《 》 used instead of parentheses or braces.

We need to produce a proper if statement.

Correct code could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively could use single line: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But they used brackets for grouping, so we need braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to output only that inside triple backticks.

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
