Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This looks like a pseudocode: if condition then some block. The syntax error likely due to '@' and '#' comments? They use @ as something? They want to use only error message "syntax error" and symbols that appear in error message. That seems odd. But we need to produce fixed code inside triple backticks. They say "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error". No symbols appear there. But maybe we can use minimal change: replace '@' with something else like ':' or something. But we don't have instruction about language. Probably they want to use `else` properly. The code currently is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

They want to use '#' to denote comments? They put `# else b = 2; #` inside comment? So the whole else clause is commented. The if statement uses `@ a = 1;` which is not valid. Maybe they intended to use `:`? In Python it's `if x > 0: a = 1` but they used parentheses. Or in other languages, use `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`. So fix by adding braces or colon. Use minimal modifications: replace `@` with `{` and add closing `}`? But then else comment not used. But we could do:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But they used comment markers. They said "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" has no symbols. So maybe we just fix by using standard syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } # else b = 2; #` But that still leaves else commented. Maybe we remove comment and add else. Provide fixed code.

Given we can't use other language knowledge? But we can produce code that compiles. I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's likely correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
