Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the code uses 《 and 》 symbols as delimiters for statements? The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
The issue: the closing delimiter after else? The else clause is 'else b = 2;' then a closing 》 after that. But the parser expects no 》 after else, because else clause is already closed. We need to remove the trailing 》 after else b = 2; So we produce:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But also we may need to remove the 》 after a=1? That might be fine. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the 》 after else is unexpected. So we remove that final 》. Also ensure we keep the 》 after the if body closed. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Let's provide that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
