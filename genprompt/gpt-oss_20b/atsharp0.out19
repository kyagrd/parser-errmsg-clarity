Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
In many languages, 'if' statement syntax wrong. Possibly it's in JavaScript? In JavaScript you use `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Remove @ and #, and ensure else matches. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or could be C. In C, need braces: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
``` 
That's it.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
