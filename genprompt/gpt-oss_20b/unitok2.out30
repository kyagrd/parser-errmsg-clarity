Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code uses weird symbols. Error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. We need to output fixed code inside triple backticks. The syntax of the code may be different, but we need to use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So perhaps the correct syntax uses 《 and 》 to delimit block. Maybe the else should not be followed by a block that ends with 》? The else part should have its own 《 》 pair. So code likely should be: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. The initial '》' after else was problematic because else clause already closed. So we need to wrap else part inside 《 》. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That likely fixes error. Output only code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
