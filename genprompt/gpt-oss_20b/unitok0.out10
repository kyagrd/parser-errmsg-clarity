Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. But we can guess the error is that they used Chinese brackets 《 and 》 instead of braces or parentheses. Also they didn't use proper syntax for if statement. It should be:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

But we need to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes. Also they used a semicolon after a = 1; within the brackets. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Return only that inside triple backticks.

Let's do.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
