Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We must fix syntax: likely use curly braces or parentheses. The code seems using brackets incorrectly. In C-like languages, use braces {}. Also missing closing bracket? There's an extra ] at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus fixed code.

Return only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
