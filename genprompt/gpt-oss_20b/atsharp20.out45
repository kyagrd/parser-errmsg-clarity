The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

Error message: "syntax error". Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We have no context on the language. But we can try to guess a plausible syntax: if statement. There's '@' which is weird. There's '#' used to comment or separate parts.

We want to produce a syntax that doesn't produce error. Use error message: "syntax error" contains no helpful characters. But we can use 'if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #'? Probably remove '@' and '#' to avoid error. Use 'else' syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. But we don't know language. But the code uses C-like syntax with parentheses and semicolons, so using braces is typical. Let's propose:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But '#' after statements might be used as comment terminator? Many languages use // or # for comment. But the code had '#' after each statement. They might indicate comment start and end. If we just remove '@' and '#', we may get correct syntax. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively use braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output the simpler one.

Given the instructions: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we can't rely on standard. But we can fix syntax errors by replacing '@' with 'then'? But no.

Simplest fix: remove '@' and '#' characters. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We must output only code in triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
