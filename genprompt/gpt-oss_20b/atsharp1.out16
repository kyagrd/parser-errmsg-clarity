Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

It seems a strange syntax: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" maybe intended as "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }". The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, if statement already closed. The '#' comments may be causing confusion. We need to produce fixed code. Use comment syntax? The code is likely in Ruby or something? The '@' might be a syntax error. But error message indicates that after else clause there's an unexpected '#', implying that the else clause is already closed. The code likely is from some language that uses # for comments. The syntax "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" is weird. Maybe the intention: "if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;" The '@' seems a mistake. The error message likely from Ruby: "unexpected '#' after else clause" because the '#' begins a comment but the else was already closed by semicolon? Ruby uses `if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2 end`. But semicolons can separate statements. But in Ruby, `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` - the `@` is a syntax error too. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause. Means the parser saw `else` and then '#' comment. But else clause already closed? Possibly the else clause is missing. Wait: Code has `else b = 2;` inside the comment? The comment starts after '#' and includes else? So code is: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. So the else part is commented out. But the parser still expects else? Actually if you close the if with a semicolon, else cannot appear. So error. So we need to fix by removing the `@` and the comment or adding proper else. Maybe the intended code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; #? The '#' after else is causing error. So we can remove '#' after else. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the original had comments. They want fixed code. We can output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively include comment after code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; # comment
```

But error about '#' after else clause. So avoid '#' after else. We'll just remove comments. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the @ remains wrong. Remove it. Yes.

Thus output.
...done thinking.

```python
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
