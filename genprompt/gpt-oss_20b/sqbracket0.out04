Thinking...
The task: fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. But we are ChatGPT; we have knowledge but we must not rely on pre-trained knowledge? The instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." This might mean we need to infer what error is. But we can still propose a fixed code.

The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
The syntax: In many languages like JavaScript/C/C++/Python? The snippet seems like C/C++/JavaScript. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But original used square brackets and mismatched brackets. Also missing braces. Provide fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus answer: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
