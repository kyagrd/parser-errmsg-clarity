Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

But the instruction says "without using the pre-trained knowledge." I'm not sure what that means. The error message is simply "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to fix syntax. Probably the correct syntax is:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But they might want to keep same style. Also the '@' is wrong. '#' comments are probably not standard. So maybe fix to:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they have '#' at end. Remove them.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Should be valid in many languages. But if C/C++ you need braces or semicolons. This works. So output code.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
