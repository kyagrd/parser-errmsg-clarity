Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot refer to programming knowledge? But we need to produce fixed code. They say output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So we should modify the code to be syntactically correct. The code snippet: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There are some errors: using @ symbol incorrectly, stray # comments maybe. Possibly they intend C or JavaScript? The @ is not allowed in if statement. In many languages, `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or using braces. But we can't use pre-trained knowledge? But we can produce a fixed code that works. The code appears to be pseudocode. We'll produce:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively single-line if else: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Use no #. The # marks comment? But # not allowed in many languages except Python. But code uses parentheses like C. So I'd remove the @ and #. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we might also want braces. I'll produce code with braces for clarity. The error message is generic "syntax error". We can't rely on knowledge. But we can guess. I'll output:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So final answer: that block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
