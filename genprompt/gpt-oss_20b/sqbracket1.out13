Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]` Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block."

We need to produce the corrected code based on the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the code uses square brackets incorrectly for braces. The code should probably be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should not use any additional explanation. Just the corrected code inside triple backticks. Let's do that.

The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`

Yes. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
