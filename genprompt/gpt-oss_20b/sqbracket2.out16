Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to remove the trailing ']' after else. Also maybe braces mismatch: They used brackets [] instead of parentheses or braces. Probably just remove last bracket. Also maybe else clause should be wrapped in [] too? But error message indicates after else clause there's an unexpected ']' because if statement closed already. So correct code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But still we have closing ']' after 'b = 2;'? Actually code: else b = 2; ] -> there is a trailing ']' after semicolon. Removing that yields: else b = 2;. The closing bracket for if condition was after a=1;] but that closes the if block. That's okay.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Return that.

...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
