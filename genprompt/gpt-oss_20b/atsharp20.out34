Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #"

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. We cannot provide explanation. We need to fix syntax error using only error message? That seems odd. We have only "syntax error" message. We must guess what's wrong. Code uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Maybe the error is `@` used incorrectly, `#` maybe comment. So we need to remove `@` and `#`. We can write: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. This is typical. We output that inside triple backticks.

But user says "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." That means we need to use the error message symbols? The error message "syntax error" contains no symbols except maybe spaces. We cannot use anything else? This is ambiguous.

We may need to preserve the style: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; The original had @ and #. We remove them. So output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We must output only this inside triple backticks. So final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
