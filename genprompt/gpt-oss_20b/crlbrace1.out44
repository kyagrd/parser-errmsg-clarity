Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code has an 'else' clause without braces but then an extra '}'. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We should remove the extra '}'. Alternatively, if they intended braces around else block: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That would be correct. So we need to output fixed code inside triple backticks.

Probably the simplest is to change to `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Let's output that.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
