Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Error message: syntax error. We must fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. That means we cannot bring in knowledge about C, Java, etc. Only using the error message "syntax error". But how do we fix? We need to produce code with no syntax error. Since error message gives no detail, we can guess to replace brackets with parentheses or something. The original code uses `[ ]` for block. Then there's an extra `]` at the end. Also missing braces for else block? We can change to `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` That seems correct syntax for C-like languages. But the problem says "syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe we can only use the symbol in error message "syntax error" - that includes letters "s y n t a x e r r o r". We can only use those symbols? That's weird. But maybe the instruction means "use symbols that appear in the error message". So we can only use characters from "syntax error": which are s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o. Let's list unique characters: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o. We cannot use other characters like parentheses or braces? We could use brackets maybe? The error message doesn't contain brackets. But it says "symbols that appear in the error message". But error message "syntax error" contains letters only. But it says symbols - maybe punctuation too? But there's only space between words and maybe the word "syntax error" includes space, but not punctuation. We cannot use parentheses? So we must re-write code using only those letters: s y n t a x e r o. We also may need punctuation like semicolons, but semicolons are not in error message. Hmm.

Maybe the intention is to simply correct the code with minimal changes: change brackets to braces, add missing bracket. Use only error message's symbols? Actually the phrase "symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Might mean we should use the error message's symbols to help fix. But error message is "syntax error", which includes the word "syntax". So maybe we can use square brackets because "syntax" includes s y n t a x - but square brackets not present. But perhaps they mean we can only use symbols that are present in the error message "syntax error", which are letters and space. That seems restrictive. But the instructions also say "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages". So we might assume a language that uses square brackets for if/else. The syntax error likely due to mismatched brackets. So we just need to balance brackets. So we can change:

`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`

Also remove stray `]` at end. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

That uses only brackets. That's a simple fix. This is likely accepted.

The instruction: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So we must output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

We should not output anything else.

Yes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
