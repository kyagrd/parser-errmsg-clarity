Thinking...
We have an error message: syntax error. The code uses non-standard brackets 《 and 》, and uses semicolons maybe. The syntax is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

It seems they use 《 and 》 as block delimiters for if and else, maybe like Chinese quotation marks? But they are mismatched: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. There's an extra closing bracket at end. The error is syntax error. We need to fix using only the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. But the error message says "syntax error", which doesn't give details. So we must use only that, but we can infer the error: mismatched brackets. So we need to correct. We need to output only fixed code inside triple backticks. So likely we should replace 《 and 》 with appropriate syntax. Maybe replace 《 with { and 》 with }. But instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error". It doesn't contain any symbols. So we can't use any special symbol from the error message because there's none. But maybe we can keep the same style but correct bracket mismatches: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That uses both opening and closing brackets. That would be syntactically correct in their language: each block uses matching 《 and 》. So we can modify the code accordingly. The code currently: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. So change to if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That fixes mismatched bracket.

Also note semicolons are within blocks. That seems fine.

So output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Check if else block missing closing? We added.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
