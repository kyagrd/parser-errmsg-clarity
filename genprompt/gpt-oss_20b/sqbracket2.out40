Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We are told to fix the syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the error is due to a stray ']' after else clause. The code uses brackets `[` and `]` to enclose the statements. The syntax may be like a language that uses square brackets for blocks instead of curly braces. The code currently has:

- if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

There is an opening bracket before `a = 1;` and a closing bracket after it. Then else is followed by `b = 2;` without brackets. Then a stray `]` after that. The else clause might need a bracket. The error message says the if statement is already closed. So the last ']' should be removed.

Thus we can fix by removing the last ']' and maybe adding a bracket after else to be symmetrical? The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message indicates unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove that last ']' and keep the rest. But we may also need to ensure syntax is correct. The code then becomes:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe else block should also be in brackets: `else [ b = 2; ]`. But the error message didn't mention missing bracket. But the code might still be considered correct with else without brackets. But the error might still remain? Let's test: The if statement opens with `[`. The block ends at `]`. Then else clause follows `else b = 2;`. The last ']' after that is stray. So the fix is to remove that. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But also maybe need to close else block: not required.

Let's produce only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
