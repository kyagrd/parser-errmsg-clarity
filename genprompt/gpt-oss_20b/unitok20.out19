Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error message: "syntax error". The instruction: Fix the syntax error in the code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge.

We cannot use pre-trained knowledge. But we need to output the fixed code. We need to think what the syntax might be. The code uses Chinese quotation marks 《 and 》. Possibly the code uses special delimiters for if statements? In many languages it's if (condition) { statements } else { statements }. But they used 《 ... 》.

But we need to "fix the syntax error" using only the error message. The error message is generic. So perhaps we need to replace the 《 and 》 with braces {}. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Notice the last 》 is extra. The correct would be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But also the last 》 might be a mistake. Or we could remove the last 》.

We could fix to:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But the original code had a trailing 》. Maybe that is causing syntax error. So just remove it.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But the instructions: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available."

Symbols that appear in the error message: "syntax error" has no symbols. So we cannot add anything new.

Thus we need to use the existing symbols: if, parentheses, brackets, 《, 》, ;, else.

Thus the minimal change: remove the trailing 》.

So output:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to also close the else block? There's no block. But maybe it's allowed.

Alternatively, maybe we need to match the delimiters: If using 《 to open and 》 to close, we need to pair them. The code currently has:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

The outermost 《 opens after if, then `a = 1;` then 》 closes. Then else b = 2; then final 》 opens? No, the final 》 has no matching opening. So remove that final 》.

Thus the fixed code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;.

Thus I will output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
