Thinking...
The prompt: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We need to produce the corrected code. The error message is generic "syntax error". The code given:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax. Likely they want to use correct syntax: if statement syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Remove stray brackets and semicolons.

Thus corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Probably no semicolon after else? Actually need semicolon after closing brace of else block. The block includes statement so ok.

Return inside triple backquotes.

Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
