Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)

It says after else clause unexpected '#'. But there is no else clause. The code has "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #"

It seems maybe the '@' is wrong? Possibly the syntax is: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; So we need to remove the '#', and remove the '@'? But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message mentions '#' after else clause. So maybe we need to remove the '#' characters. Also maybe the '@' is a syntax error? But not in the error message. The code is like custom language. We can try:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we still have '@'. But error only complains about '#'. Might be fine to keep '@'.

But the error says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means the parser sees '#' after else clause. It likely expects the else clause to be terminated differently. So we can just remove '#'.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, maybe we need to escape '#'. But instruction: use only symbols that appear in error message. The '#' appears. But we removed them. But maybe we need to keep them as comments? Not sure. Let's stick to removal.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's output exactly that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
