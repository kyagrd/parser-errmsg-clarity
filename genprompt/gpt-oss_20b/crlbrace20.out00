Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. The original:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There's an extra closing brace at end. Also else block missing braces. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or if we want to keep style: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` but need to remove extra }. We can just remove the last `}`. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But might be ambiguous. The question: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message: "syntax error". There's no symbol in that. But we can just fix it by removing the stray brace.

Better to produce a fixed version. I'd output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe they expect braces around else. Typically else block should be in braces for multi statements. Since only one assignment, else without braces is ok. But the stray `}` is the error.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
