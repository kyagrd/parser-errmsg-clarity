Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message. The error message is generic "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge. But we can deduce the syntax of the code. The code has: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

It appears wrong: braces wrong. We need to correct to typical syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also remove trailing ]. The error message: syntax error. So we produce code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should output only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
