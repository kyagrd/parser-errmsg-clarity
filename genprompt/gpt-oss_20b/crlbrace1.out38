Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace '}' after the else clause. The if statement already closed. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So to fix, we remove the stray '}'. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But note: In C-like languages, else clause should have braces or assignment but with a single statement it's fine: else b = 2; is okay? Actually else requires statement; but syntax wise "else b = 2;" is allowed because assignment is a statement. But might need braces to avoid confusion. But the fix is to remove '}'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return that.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
