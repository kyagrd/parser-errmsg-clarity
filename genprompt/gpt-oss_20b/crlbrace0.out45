Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? That instruction is odd. They say: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." But we are ChatGPT, have pre-trained knowledge, but maybe they mean use only the error message? That seems ambiguous. But we just need to output the fixed code inside triple backticks. So we need to correct syntax. Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

There is an extra closing brace at the end. Also missing braces around else. It should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also the trailing } removed. So final code: inside backticks. Ensure only code. So produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's the answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
