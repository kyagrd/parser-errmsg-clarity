Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, which mentions 'unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)'. So likely the brackets are mismatched. The code uses unusual brackets 《 and 》 instead of parentheses or braces. It should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But they want to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message includes '》' after else clause. So maybe need to close else with 》? But original had 'if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》'. There is an opening 《 after condition, then inside a =1; then closing 》. Then else b = 2; 》. That final 》 is probably wrong. They might want to close the if block before else. So maybe the corrected code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 ?

But the error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies the 》 after else is unexpected because the if statement already closed earlier. So the 》 after else should be removed. Also else statement might need braces or 》 around its block? The code uses 《...》 as block delimiters. So we need to remove the 》 after else. Also maybe else should also be wrapped. But error says after else clause (if statement already closed). That means we close if early, then else can't have block. So the fix is to remove the last 》, and possibly add a block after else.

But we can't use pre-trained knowledge; we only use error message. It says 'unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)'. So we remove that 》. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

But the code might still have missing closing for else block? But else b = 2; is just a statement, no block needed. So that should compile.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

We output only that code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
