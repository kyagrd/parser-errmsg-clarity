Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message (syntax error). No pre-trained knowledge. Just fix code. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to correct syntax. Possibly use parentheses, brackets, braces. The error indicates syntax error. We need to produce code that uses symbols that appear in error message: "syntax error". It says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we only use the words in the error message. But the error message is just "syntax error". So we can only use those words: "syntax", "error". But we still need code. But we cannot use pre-trained knowledge of syntax. This is tricky: They want us to correct syntax using symbols that appear in the error message. The error message contains no symbols, just words. But maybe they mean use symbols that appear in the error message? The error message has no symbols. But maybe they mean "symbols" as letters? Or maybe they refer to characters that appear: space, 's', 'y', 'n', 't', 'a', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'r'. But that seems nonsense.

However the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we need to use only the symbols that appear in the error message: "syntax error" includes letters and space. But we cannot use punctuation like brackets. But code uses brackets.

But maybe they mean we can use any symbol that appears in the error message (like 's', 'y', 'n', etc.) But that seems impossible to write code.

Alternatively, maybe they just want a fixed code that uses proper syntax: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But they specifically say DO NOT output your thinking process. Only output the fixed code inside triple backticks. Also note: "using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge." That's a weird instruction. But maybe they want us to fix the code by using only symbols that appear in the error message "syntax error". That includes letters 's', 'y', 'n', 't', 'a', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'o', ' '.

We can write code using only those letters: maybe "if" uses letters 'i' and 'f' which are not in error message. So we cannot use them. So we cannot write "if". But we can maybe use 'x', 'y', 'n', 't', etc. But we cannot use parentheses? But parentheses '(', ')' are not in error message. So can't use them either.

Thus maybe we can just output the code as is but correct bracket mismatch: remove stray ']' at end. 
Original code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ] 
We can fix to: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
But still has bracket mismatch? There is an opening '[' before a = 1; and closing ']' after that. Then 'else b = 2;' no brackets. Then stray ']' removed. So code becomes:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
But maybe syntax error still due to using '[' instead of '{'. But they said syntax may be different. So we just need to fix bracket mismatch.

Thus answer: output the code with one less closing bracket.

Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

We are using only symbols that appear in error message? That code uses parentheses, brackets, semicolons, greater than, etc. Not all from error message. But we ignore that.

I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
