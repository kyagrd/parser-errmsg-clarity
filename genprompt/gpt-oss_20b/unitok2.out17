Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We have an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We must use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. So we should only use symbols that appear in the error message? The error message mentions '》' and maybe 'else clause (if statement already closed)'. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause. So likely the '》' after else is wrong. Also there is an unmatched '》' at the end. So fix by removing those '》' symbols after else and at the end? The code uses 《 and 》 as brackets? The code uses if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we can rewrite as:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

But also the last '》' should be removed. The first 《 is matched by the first 》. The last '》' is extra. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Yes. That uses only symbols from the error message? It uses '》' and '《', which appear in error message? The error message mentions '》'. The 《 symbol didn't appear but it's used in the code. But okay. The instruction says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we remove the '》' after else. Use only error message symbols. The only error message symbol is '》'. So we will keep '》' where needed? The code uses '》' after a = 1; to close block. That is fine. Remove the trailing '》'. Also the error says unexpected '》' after else clause. So we should not put '》' after else. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

Thus we output that code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
