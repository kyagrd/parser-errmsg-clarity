Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has syntax errors. They want to use only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. But we must produce correct code.

Given original:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It appears to use some Chinese quotation-like characters: 《 and 》. They should be replaced by parentheses or curly braces? In typical code, we need to write:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the error says unexpected '》' after else clause. So we should replace the characters. So correct code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wrap in triple backticks. Probably they want that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
