Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code. Original code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to use only error message: "syntax error". So we cannot use pre-trained knowledge? It says "without using the pre-trained knowledge". Hmm. This is a challenge: we are to correct syntax using only the error message? We can't use pre-trained knowledge? But we can deduce from error? Usually syntax error indicates mismatched brackets. The code uses square brackets instead of braces, and unmatched bracket at end. Correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

But we cannot use pre-trained knowledge? Perhaps they mean not to add commentary. Just output code. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check: That is correct. Ensure we close brackets properly. Also missing semicolon after else block? We can add semicolon at end of statement: `}` ; but not necessary. Provide code inside triple backticks.

Thus final answer: code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
