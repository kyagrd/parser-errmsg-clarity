Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? Means we can't use prior knowledge, but we can guess. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

There is an unmatched closing brace and else missing braces. Should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Remove extra '}' at end. So fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
