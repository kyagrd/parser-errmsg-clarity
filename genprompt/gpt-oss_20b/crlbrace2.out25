Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has an extra '}' at the end. So we remove that last '}'. Also we should ensure else clause syntax matches: else b = 2; is okay? Usually else needs braces or statement. That is fine. So fix: remove last '}'. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Also maybe need braces around else? Not necessary. So output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
