Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
There's an extra closing brace '}' after else clause. Error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we need to remove that extra '}'. Also else clause: after else should be a block? But syntax may allow else without braces. So we can simply remove the trailing '}'. Also else b = 2; is okay. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` So inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
