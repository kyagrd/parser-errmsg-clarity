Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has mismatched brackets.

Original code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
The syntax uses '[' instead of '{' and mismatched closing brackets. In JavaScript, if statements use {} or no braces if single statement. But the code uses [ ... ] incorrectly.

Also the else clause missing braces. There's an extra ']' at end.

We need to output only fixed code inside triple backticks. Use correct syntax.

So we can rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's the fixed code.

Ensure we output only code block, nothing else.

Let's produce.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
