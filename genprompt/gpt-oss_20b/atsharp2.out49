Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

They mention that code syntax may differ from existing languages. They want to use only symbols that appear in error message? It says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message contains: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we have symbols: `#`, `else`, `if`, `(`, `)`, etc. But we need to fix syntax. In many languages, else comes after closing of if block. But here, the code uses `#` comments maybe. Perhaps the correct syntax is to move the else into same line or comment. We need to use only symbols from error message: `#`, `else`, `if`, parentheses, maybe space, colon. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

Maybe the syntax is: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;` Remove comment markers (#). But the error message says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the else clause is commented out with '#', causing parser to think else not closed. So we remove '#' after else or move else before '#'. We can place '#' at start of comment only. But we cannot use any symbol not in error message? We can use `;` etc. But to be safe, output fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`

But maybe they want to preserve comment markers? Not needed. So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`

We should output inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
