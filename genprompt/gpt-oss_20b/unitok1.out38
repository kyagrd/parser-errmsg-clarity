Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses Chinese brackets 《》 incorrectly. The syntax error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses wrong brackets. We need to fix to proper syntax. In C-like languages? Probably. So replace 《 with { and 》 with }. Also else clause must be same braces. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Ensure no other changes. That's it.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
