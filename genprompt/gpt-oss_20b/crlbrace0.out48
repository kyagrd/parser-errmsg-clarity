Thinking...
The user: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We have the error message: "syntax error". The code: 

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax. The code uses C-like syntax. The error: unmatched closing brace? There's an extra } at end. Also else block missing braces. So fix to:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we need to remove extra closing brace. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Output only fixed code inside triple backquote.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
