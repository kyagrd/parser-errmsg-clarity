Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? That seems odd. They give code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to produce fixed code inside triple backquote code block. The code appears like C or C++ or Java. There's a stray '@', '#', comments incorrectly placed. The correct syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

So we should output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to keep comment? They said use ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Hmm. But we just produce the fixed code.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Check if any other syntax errors: We need to have ; after else block? The semicolon is okay. So that's the answer.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
