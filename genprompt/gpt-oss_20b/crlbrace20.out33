Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to fix syntax error. The code seems like C-like. There is an extra closing brace after else part. The correct syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } or else b = 2; (without braces). But there's an extra closing brace. So we can remove the last '}'. Also else part: "else b = 2;" is okay if no braces. But we have two semicolons: else b = 2; } - after removing '}', it's fine. But there's also 'else b = 2;' no braces. However the 'if' block had braces. It's fine: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; Should compile. But the code had an extra '}'. So the fix: remove the last '}'. Alternatively, we could add a brace after else to match. But simpler: remove extra brace. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
That seems right.

Thus output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
