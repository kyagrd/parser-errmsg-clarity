Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra closing brace. Also else statement missing braces? In languages like C, else requires braces if you want multiple statements. The syntax error likely due to mismatched braces. The correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } Removing the stray '}'. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
