Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code, using only the error message. The error message is "syntax error". We cannot use pre-trained knowledge? That instruction says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we should use only the error message to deduce the fix, but that is unclear. But we can guess the error: The code has some unusual characters: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The syntax looks like it's trying to use angle brackets or some Chinese quotation marks. The correct syntax in many languages like C/C++/JavaScript is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Thus the fix is to replace 《 and 》 with braces {}. Also remove the stray 》 at end. So final code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

We should output only the fixed code inside triple backquote. No explanation.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
