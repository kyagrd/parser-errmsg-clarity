Thinking...
We need to output the fixed code inside triple backquotes. We cannot add explanation. We need to fix syntax error. The code given:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see an extra closing brace '}' at the end. Also missing braces for else? The correct code might be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But if the syntax allows else without braces, we could just remove the extra closing brace. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Better to add braces for consistency: `else { b = 2; }`. The error message just "syntax error". The instructions: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we should use only the error message to fix? It says "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error" - no symbols. So maybe we cannot use any symbols from error message because none. But we can still fix the code by removing extra brace. But the instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That's confusing. They want us to use the error message to fix. But there's nothing in error message. So maybe we interpret that we cannot use knowledge about syntax from our training. We just rely on the code and error message. But we still need to produce the fixed code. The safest is to produce the corrected code with correct braces. I'd output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But note that the original code had an extra '}'. Remove it. And add missing braces around else. So final code.

Return only the code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
