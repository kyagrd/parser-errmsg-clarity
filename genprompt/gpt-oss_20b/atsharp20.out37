Thinking...
We have a prompt: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block. The code syntax may be different from known languages. We have to try to fix using symbols that appear in the error message if available. The error message just says "syntax error". That doesn't give any hints about what to change. We have to fix the syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There are a few potential syntax issues: The '@' symbol after the if condition. Also the `#` comment characters at the end. The code might be intended to be like: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; Perhaps they used '@' incorrectly. Maybe the correct syntax is to use `:`, `then`, or something. But we only have error message "syntax error". The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message only contains the words 'syntax' and 'error'. There are no symbols in the error message. So we can't rely on that. But we can fix the code to be syntactically correct. Without pre-trained knowledge? They said without using pre-trained knowledge. But we can't cheat. But maybe the instruction is a trick: We should not use pre-trained knowledge, but we are allowed to use symbols from error message. There are no symbols. So we can't do that. Perhaps we just output a plausible corrected code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
Remove the '@' and '#' characters. That would fix syntax error. The output must be inside triple backquote code block. So the output should be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
