Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. That instruction is weird. They say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we cannot rely on known syntax. But we can still produce corrected code. The error message is "syntax error". They didn't specify language, but code snippet suggests maybe PHP or some language? It's like "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" This seems like PHP, where @ suppresses errors, but not typical. Or maybe a pseudo language. But the task: fix syntax error. So correct the syntax: we need proper if statement with braces, else part. Also remove stray '#' characters. So something like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But also if it's PHP, syntax: if ($x > 0) { $a = 1; } else { $b = 2; }

But variable names. I'll produce generic.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
