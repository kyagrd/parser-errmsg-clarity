Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace '}' after the else clause. Also the else clause syntax might need braces for the statement. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the '}' is unexpected because the if statement already closed. So we need to remove that '}'.

Also else clause maybe need braces: else { b = 2; } But error doesn't mention that, but maybe acceptable.

We can just remove the extra '}'. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But then else clause might need braces? Not necessarily. The syntax of code may be similar to C-like. Else without braces is allowed.

So output fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
