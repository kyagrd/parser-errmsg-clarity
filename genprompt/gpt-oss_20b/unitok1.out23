Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses Chinese quotation marks or angle brackets. The error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So they use wrong brackets. We should replace the Chinese angle brackets 《 and 》 with curly braces or just remove them. In C-like syntax, use curly braces: 

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we can also keep single statements without braces: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That is also fine. The original code had no semicolons after the else clause. It uses `else b = 2; 》`. So we should fix to either use braces or just remove the `》`. The error mentions unexpected `》` after else clause. So we can change to:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the code also had `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》` which is incorrect syntax. We need to replace the 《 and 》 around a = 1 with something else. So maybe just remove them: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

However the problem statement: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we must only use the error message. The error message says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we must not use other knowledge. But we can still deduce that the issue is the Chinese characters. So we just correct by removing them or replacing with proper braces. The simplest is to replace 《 with { and 》 with }. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
