Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has an extra closing brace at end. Also else syntax wrong: else without block needs statement. But they likely want to wrap else block: else { b = 2; }. Also remove extra }. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
