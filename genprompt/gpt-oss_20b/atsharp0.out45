Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. This looks like JavaScript? Or C? The syntax: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The `@` is invalid; maybe they intended to write `a = 1;`? Also the `#` comments? In many languages, `#` isn't a comment. In Python, `#` comment but `if (x > 0)` parentheses not needed. So maybe it's Python code but using `@` erroneously. So we need to correct syntax: In Python, `if x > 0: a = 1` else: b = 2. Use colon, no parentheses. Remove `#` at end. So final code:

```
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote. So respond with that.
...done thinking.

```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
