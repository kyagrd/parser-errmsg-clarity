Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error in code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.

We are told not to use pre-trained knowledge, only use error message (syntax error). They say note that syntax may be different, and try to fix using symbols that appear in error message if available. But error message only says "syntax error" – no specific symbol.

Thus we need to correct the code to be syntactically correct according to likely language. The original uses weird brackets 《 and 》. Likely they intend something like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, use parentheses for blocks. Use braces. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`

We output this code in triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We must be careful not to add extra lines.

Thus final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
