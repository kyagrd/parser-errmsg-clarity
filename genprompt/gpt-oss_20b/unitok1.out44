Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses '《' and '》' maybe as custom brackets. The error: after else clause, the if already closed, then the '》' after else is unexpected. We need to replace with correct syntax. Use only the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. But we can interpret: Unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means after the else clause we have stray '》'. In original code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

The if clause: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 . That encloses a = 1; inside '《' '》' maybe a syntax. Then else b = 2; 》. The else clause is missing its own braces, but then there's an extra '》' at the end. So we need to remove the stray '》'. Also maybe use proper braces. But they said using only the error message. The error message says after else clause, '》' unexpected. So we just remove the stray '》' after else. Also need to close with a '》'? Actually the else clause has no '《', only 'b = 2; 》'. That '》' at end is stray. So remove that. So final code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

But still '《' '》' usage might be wrong. But we stick to original style. So final code inside triple backticks.

Let's produce output.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
