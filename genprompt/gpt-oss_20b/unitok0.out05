Thinking...
We have code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

This appears to use weird angled brackets "《" and "》". The correct syntax in many languages (C, Java, etc.) uses parentheses and curly braces. The code likely intends to be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the error message "syntax error" suggests the issue is the angle brackets. Using only the error message? It says syntax error, but we can't know more. The fix is to replace 《 and 》 with { and }.

We also see "else b = 2; 》". There's an extra 》 at end. So we need to close the if block properly.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That is the fixed code.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Check if any trailing characters remain: The original had `》` at the end. We removed that. That's correct.

Thus answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
