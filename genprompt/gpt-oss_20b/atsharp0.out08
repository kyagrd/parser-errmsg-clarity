Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. That instruction seems a bit confusing: we should use only the error message? But we need to provide fixed code. Let's think: The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to produce correct code. Likely the intention is:

- Remove the '@' character.
- Replace the comment-like '#' with proper comments or remove them.

In Python, the syntax is:

```
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

But given the code uses C-style syntax, but includes '#' which is a comment in shell but not in C. The '@' is invalid. So the fix: remove '@' and replace '# else b = 2; #' with 'else b = 2;'.

Alternatively, maybe we just need to remove the '@' and keep the code as is? But still '#' would cause syntax error. So we should comment out the else part or remove '#'.

So the corrected code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But that's still invalid in C? In C, you need braces or you can have single statement after if: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That's valid.

Thus, output code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, if they want proper code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But they asked: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is ambiguous. They want just the fixed code. So likely just remove '@' and '#' characters. So output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
