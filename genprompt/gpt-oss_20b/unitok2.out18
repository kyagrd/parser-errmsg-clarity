Thinking...
The code uses 《 and 》 presumably to denote blocks? Error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means that the else clause expects some code but the '》' indicates closure. We need to rearrange so else clause doesn't have a closing right before b = 2; Also need to close the if statement properly. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. We have an extra 》 at end. Maybe should be: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That uses 》 after else block. So we need to wrap else part in 《... 》. Also the final 》 is redundant. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That matches syntax of language using 《 for block start and 》 for block end. Provide inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
