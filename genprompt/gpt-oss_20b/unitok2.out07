Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code inside triple backticks. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses 《 and 》 as braces? In the code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. So after else, there is a '》' that indicates closure but the if already closed. So we need to remove the final '》' or adjust syntax. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So remove the final '》'. The correct code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;. That's likely the fix. Ensure we keep the initial 《 and 》 around a = 1; and keep the else part but no closing 》. The code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
