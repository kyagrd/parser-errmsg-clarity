Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in code. The code uses symbols: 《 and 》, likely used as brackets? The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

There is mismatch: open 《 before a=1; but close 》 after that and then else b=2; and then another 》? The code uses mismatched brackets. Perhaps the intended syntax uses 《 and 》 as braces. The correct syntax would be:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

But the original has an extra 》 at end. So the fix: change the code to have proper matching brackets. The error message is just "syntax error". We need to use symbols in the error message? The error message contains only "syntax error". There's no symbol there. But we can choose correct bracket characters from code. So the fixed code: Use matching 《 and 》:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```

Also close with matching 》. Let's output only the code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
