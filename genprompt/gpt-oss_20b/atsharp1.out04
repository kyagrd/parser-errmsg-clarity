Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But we can guess: '#' is a comment. In many languages, else clause cannot be followed by '#', but we need to fix syntax. The code shows an if statement, then `@` before a variable? That's weird. The syntax likely should be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But maybe the original is some pseudocode? We need to output fixed code inside triple backticks. They say "only the error message", but maybe we can fix the syntax. I'll produce a version with proper else:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But if the language is JavaScript, the `@` is invalid. Should be just `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The error refers to '#', which is comment. So remove '# else b = 2; #' and replace with else. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We need to choose which. The error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". This implies that the else clause is closed already? Actually, the code had `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The `@` might be a syntax for assignment in some languages? The `@` is likely not intended. The else part is commented out incorrectly. So fix by removing the comments and replacing with proper else. The minimal fix: replace `# else b = 2; #` with `else b = 2;`. Also remove `@`. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Yes. I'll output that.

...done thinking.

```plaintext
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
