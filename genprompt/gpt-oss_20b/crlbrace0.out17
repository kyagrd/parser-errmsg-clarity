Thinking...
We have an error: syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Missing something. The if syntax: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }. In the code, the else is followed by 'b = 2;' without braces. That's allowed? In JavaScript or C? In C, else { ... } required if you want multiple statements. But here only one statement, so else b = 2; is okay. But the trailing '}' after else statement? That is unmatched closing brace. So remove the last '}'. Also missing semicolon after else? In C, syntax: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That's okay. So fix: remove trailing '}'. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We might want to add semicolon after else? Already there. So final answer: code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
