Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using only error message, cannot use pre-trained knowledge. But we can guess that code is something like:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We need to produce code block with fixed code.

We have syntax error. We need to use symbols that appear in error message "syntax error". But the error message only includes "syntax error". No symbol.

But we might need to fix bracket mismatch. The code has mismatched brackets: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

It uses square brackets for block instead of braces. Also trailing bracket at end is extra.

Maybe we fix by removing last bracket. So final code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; 

But we might also change square brackets to braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 

But maybe syntax of language uses brackets for blocks. We can keep square brackets but correct extra bracket. So:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

This should compile. So we output code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
