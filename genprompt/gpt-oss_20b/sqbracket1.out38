Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

In C-like syntax, should use braces { } not brackets [ ]. Also closing bracket after else? The else part should be a block if using braces. Let's rewrite:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also remove stray closing ']' at end. So output code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
