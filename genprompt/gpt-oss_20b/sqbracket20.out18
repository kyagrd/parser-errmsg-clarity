Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We have mismatched brackets: opening [ after condition, and closing ] after else? We likely want:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But they say syntax may be different. Use brackets maybe? They used [ for block. The else block missing braces. Also stray ] at end.

We can fix by matching brackets: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

Also remove trailing ]. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

But there is a trailing ] at end currently. Remove. So answer.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
