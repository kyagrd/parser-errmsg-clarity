Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

This uses Chinese brackets 《 》 instead of parentheses or curly braces. In JavaScript? Probably it's meant to be C? The error: syntax error.

We need to replace 《 a = 1; 》 with braces or something. In C-like languages, correct syntax:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or if we want single statements, we can remove braces. But the "else b = 2;" is fine without braces if single statement. But with braces it's clearer. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it. Output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
