Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. But we have code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
In C-like languages, if condition uses parentheses, then statement block uses braces {} not brackets []. Also missing braces after else? The code has mismatched brackets: uses [ and ]. Also stray closing bracket at end. Should use braces and semicolons properly: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But they might allow single statements without braces. But still bracket usage is wrong. So fix: replace [ with { and ] with } accordingly. Also remove extra closing bracket at end. So final code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Yes.

Return only code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
