Thinking...
We have code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses brackets [ ] perhaps intended as some custom syntax. We need to remove extraneous ] after else. The error message says unexpected ']' after else clause, if statement already closed. So we should remove the trailing ] after the else clause. The code currently: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We need to keep syntax of the language as similar. Probably correct is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Thus removed trailing ]. Ensure we keep semicolons. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

We output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
