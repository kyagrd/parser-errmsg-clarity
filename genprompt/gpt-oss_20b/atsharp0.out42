Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, but we can analyze. Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Probably language is some C-like? Syntax error because of '@' and '#' comment char? In C, comment starts with // or /* */. '#' not comment. '@' not valid. So remove '@' and comments. Use proper else syntax:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Add semicolons. So final code.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
