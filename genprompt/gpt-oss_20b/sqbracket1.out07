Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. But as ChatGPT we can just provide corrected code. We need to use only the error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we should only refer to the error message and not use other knowledge. But the error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the syntax error is that there's an extra ']' after else clause. The code has `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So we need to remove the bracket after else clause. The correct syntax likely: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }` but the original used square brackets. However the error message indicates using else clause closed. But the only fix is remove the last `]`. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. But also the square brackets maybe used for block? Not typical but maybe allowed in some languages? The code might be from some language that uses `[` `]` as code block. But anyway we remove the trailing bracket.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Return code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
