Thinking...
We have an instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. The error message is "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to fix syntax error using only symbols that appear in error message. The error message only says "syntax error". That contains letters s y n t a x e r r o r. Maybe we can only use symbols from that string. But they say "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can't use knowledge of language syntax. We only have the error message "syntax error". We must use symbols that appear in the error message, if available.

So we must rewrite code to correct syntax error, but only using symbols that appear in "syntax error". Those symbols are letters: s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r. Maybe punctuation? The error message "syntax error" contains a space. Maybe we can't use parentheses? But the only allowed symbols are letters from "syntax error". Maybe we can also use digits? But digits not in the error message. Maybe we can use @, #? Not allowed? The instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use symbols that appear in the error message: letters s y n t a x e r. That excludes punctuation like parentheses, @, #, semicolon. But the code currently uses those punctuation, but we need to replace them with allowed symbols. Maybe we need to remove punctuation entirely? But we need a valid code, but syntax unknown. Maybe we need to produce a fixed code that uses only allowed symbols.

However, maybe the instruction allows us to use other characters but we should try to use symbols from error message if available. But "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can still use other symbols but prefer to use those. But maybe it's expecting a simple transformation: replace '@' with 'then' or 'else'? But those words contain letters from error message. For example, 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1;' could be 'if (x > 0) then a = 1;' but 'then' uses letters t h e n, 'h' not in error message. So not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the syntax error is due to '@' and '#' and semicolons. We could just remove them, e.g.:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But still parentheses, semicolons. But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So maybe we just need to correct the syntax by removing stray symbols like '@', '#', and semicolons. The only error is the stray '@' and '#'. So we can produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they ask to use ONLY the error message, but we can use other symbols? Not sure.

But maybe they want to use "syntax error" as a hint: "syntax" is the word "syntax". So we can fix by rewriting using 'syntax' as the keyword? Not likely.

Let's analyze: The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error is likely due to stray '@' and '#', and maybe semicolons inside comment markers (#). In many languages, '#' starts a comment; everything after is ignored. So the code inside comment may have stray '@' etc. But the error might be due to '@' not being recognized. So we can simply remove '@', and remove '#', and maybe change the structure.

Thus, the fixed code could be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

I think that's fine.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
