Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Using ONLY the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely the code uses some custom brackets. The '》' is some closing symbol? The error indicates that the else clause has an unexpected '》' after it, meaning the else clause already closed.

We need to correct syntax: replace 《 and 》 with proper braces or parentheses. In many languages, e.g., C, if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the question says only use error message, without pre-trained knowledge. So we need to output fixed code.

We should just replace 《 and 》 with { and }. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we also have an extra '》' at the end of line: there's '》' after else b = 2; 》. So we remove that. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Replace 《 with {, 》 with }. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This is the fixed code.

Thus output only the code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
