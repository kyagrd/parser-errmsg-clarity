Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely missing closing bracket for if block? The code uses square brackets for blocks? So after else clause there's an extra ']' closing bracket. Remove it. Also maybe need to close else block? But else block is just "b = 2;". No bracket. So remove the last ']'. Also maybe need to open bracket for else? If using brackets for blocks, else block may also need brackets? Not necessary per syntax? But error message refers to extra ']' after else clause. So removing that resolves. So fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
Check if any other missing bracket? The if block opened '[' after condition, closed after a=1; then else. That seems fine. So output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
