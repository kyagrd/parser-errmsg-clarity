Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

It has syntax errors: Use parentheses or braces. Also extra bracket. The error message: syntax error. They ask to fix using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we can just produce correct code. So we need to output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Probably the corrected code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, maybe it's in C style. The error arises due to brackets `[ ]` being used incorrectly; should use `{ }`. Also remove trailing `]`.

So produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
