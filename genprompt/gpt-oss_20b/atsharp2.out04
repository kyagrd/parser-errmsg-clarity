Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in code. The error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. We need to modify only using symbols that appear in error message. The error message contains: unexpected, '#', after, else, clause, (if statement already closed). So we can use '#', else, if, statement, clause, after, unexpected, etc. We should output fixed code only inside triple backticks. Must not output reasoning. So final answer: need to adjust syntax: maybe remove '#'. The code might be:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." We can use '#', but error indicates '# after else clause is unexpected'. So maybe we need to remove '#'. We can produce fixed code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems correct.

But also "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we can't rely on understanding of syntax. We just see that '#' after else clause is unexpected. So we remove '#'. So output code.

Thus answer: ```if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;``` with triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
