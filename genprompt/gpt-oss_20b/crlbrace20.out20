Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Observations: mismatched braces: one too many at end. Also else clause missing braces: else b = 2; should be else { b = 2; }.

Also semicolons after assignments fine. Need to match braces: if (...) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Remove trailing }. So fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Return code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
