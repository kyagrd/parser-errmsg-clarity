Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message? The instruction says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we should only refer to the error message "syntax error". So we can deduce that the code is incorrectly formed. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. In many languages like C, Java, Python, etc, it's wrong. It has `@` operator not valid, comment characters `#` not typical except Python, but Python uses `#` comment and no semicolons needed. The code seems maybe from Python but uses `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`. In Python, if you want to test `if x > 0:` then block. But we can rewrite as:

```
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

But instruction: "ONLY the error message" implies we can't use pre-trained knowledge; we just need to fix syntax error, maybe simplest: remove the @ and change comment syntax to Python style? But we don't know language.

Simplify: Use C-like syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The '#' are comment markers causing syntax error. Replace them with `//` or remove them. But we don't know language.

Let's assume it's C. Then fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But `@` is wrong. Remove it. The code after fix:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But if we output only fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
