Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)"

Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We need to produce the fixed code only inside triple backquotes.

The code uses some weird punctuation characters 《 and 》. We need to remove them or replace them with correct syntax. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code likely intended to be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But they used special characters. So the fixed code should be something like:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Thus output that.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
