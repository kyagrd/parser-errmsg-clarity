Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means there is an extra closing bracket ']' after else clause. Also there's syntax error: using square brackets instead of curly braces or parentheses. In C-like languages, if statement uses curly braces or no braces. But the error indicates that the code had 'if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]' - there's an extra ']' after else b = 2; The error message says 'if statement already closed', so the else is after the closing ']' of the if. So we need to remove the extra ']' after else. Also we might need to replace square brackets with curly braces or just remove them? The prompt says "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can only rely on the error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies we should remove the ']' after else clause. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` However there might also be a missing closing ']' after the 'a = 1;' but it's present. The code uses square brackets for blocks, which is unusual but might be allowed? But the error says unexpected ']' after else clause. So just remove that last ']':

`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`

Thus we output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Probably that's the answer.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
