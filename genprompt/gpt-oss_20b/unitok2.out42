Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we should remove or reposition '》'. The code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters. Maybe the syntax uses 《 as opening, 》 as closing. The if statement should be: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》? But the error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if already closed). That means the '》' after else is misplaced. So remove it or wrap else in delimiters. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. So inside code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
