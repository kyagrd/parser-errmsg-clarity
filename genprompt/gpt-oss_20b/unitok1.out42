Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error in the code. The error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the syntax uses some wrong brackets: `《` and `》`. These appear to be like Chinese brackets, but not proper syntax. In C or similar languages, should be `{}`. Also the if statement syntax is: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or if no braces, then single statement. The given code is: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. So likely they want to replace 《 with `{` and 》 with `}`. But need to close properly: The else clause should have its own block. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Alternatively if want single statement else, could be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But given the closing bracket at end, maybe they want block after else too. So use curly braces for else block. Provide only the fixed code in triple backticks. No extra text.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
