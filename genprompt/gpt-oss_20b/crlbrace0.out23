Thinking...
The prompt: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we only have the error message "syntax error" and code. We need to fix syntax error.

Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Observations: There are mismatched braces. The else clause missing braces? It has `else b = 2; }`. The extra closing brace at end. So correct syntax likely: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So remove extra brace or add braces accordingly. The error message only says syntax error, but no details. The instruction says: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can't rely on prior knowledge, but we can still guess from code. But they want us to output only fixed code.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's produce that.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
