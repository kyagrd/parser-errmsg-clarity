Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in the code using only error message "syntax error" without pre-trained knowledge. But we are allowed to use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message is "syntax error". It contains "syntax error" - but no symbols. But maybe we can infer that the code uses a syntax like "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". It seems erroneous due to "@" symbol used instead of "then" or something. Perhaps the intended syntax is "if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;". The "#" at end might be comment. The code uses "@" and "#". Maybe the correct syntax is:

if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #

But that still has syntax error due to "# else b = 2; #"? Maybe the comment starts with # and everything until end-of-line is comment. So after "# else b = 2; #" it is comment. So code is: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; then the @ is wrong. So fix: if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Alternatively maybe "@" should be ":"? But typical syntax: "if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;". So maybe the correct code is:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; #

But # at end? The comment might start at #, so the entire " else b = 2; #" is comment. So maybe it's "if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #" but that would still have syntax error because of "else" being part of comment. So I'd simply remove the else comment. Provide code with no syntax error. So the fixed code:

if (x > 0) a = 1;

But we might need semicolon? Already has. That should be okay.

But requirement: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we can only refer to "syntax error". But we can use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message "syntax error" contains no symbols. So we can't rely on that. Maybe the instruction means: use only the error message, i.e., we should produce code that removes error but not add new features. I think we just output corrected code.

Thus output: 

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

But that still has syntax error? Wait: The code still has "@" removed? Actually we removed "@". The rest remains. The code originally had "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". So we change "@" to maybe "then". But unknown.

Better to rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This might still produce syntax error due to stray "# else". But if '#' is comment indicator, then the entire line after '#' is comment. So the code is `if (x > 0) a = 1;`. So that should be fine.

Thus final answer: only the fixed code block.

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
