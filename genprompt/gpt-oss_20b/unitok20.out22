Thinking...
The user: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." The error message: syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code syntax may be different from existing languages. They mention that we should use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is "syntax error". The code uses unusual brackets: 《 and 》. We need to fix the syntax error. The code is likely incorrectly using brackets. We can try to change the brackets to standard ones: maybe replace 《 and 》 with parentheses or curly braces. But they said "NOTE: The syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" contains the word "syntax". Not helpful. We could replace the brackets with '(', ')' or '{', '}'. They used "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》" The final '》' maybe unmatched. The "if" clause: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》 . The structure likely: if (condition) { statements } else { statements } . The code currently uses 《 for opening and 》 for closing maybe for the 'if' block and also at the end. There's an unmatched '》'. So we can replace the first 《 with '{' and the matching 》 with '}'. Then the last 》 might be removed. So corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to wrap else block too: else { b = 2; }. But original had else b = 2; which is fine. But we could also wrap else. But simplest: fix by replacing brackets with braces. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, keep brackets: if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2; But we might need parentheses? Not typical.

The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message has "syntax". But no symbols. So we ignore.

Thus output only the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
