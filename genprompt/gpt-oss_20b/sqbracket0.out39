Thinking...
We need to correct syntax error. The original code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Observations: Using square brackets instead of curly braces or parentheses. Also mismatched brackets. Also missing semicolons maybe. We need to produce correct syntax. Could be C style: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Provide fixed code block.

Also note there's an extra closing bracket `]` at end. Remove it. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Return only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
