Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to modify using symbols that appear in error message: maybe we remove '#' after else clause. There's a '# else b = 2; #' part. The else clause seems incorrect. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So perhaps we should remove the '#' after else? Or maybe put the '#' before else? But we can't use other symbols. Let's interpret that we need to remove the '#' after else clause or after if. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; # . There is a '#' before else, after a semicolon. That might be an error. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). That implies the '#' after else clause is unexpected. So we need to remove the '#' after else clause. So final code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; . Wait the '#' before else might still be okay? But the error says after else clause, meaning after 'else b = 2;'. The '#' after that is unexpected. So remove trailing '#'. The code becomes: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
But there is still a '#' before else. Might be fine. They said error message only, using symbols that appear in the error message. The symbols in error message: unexpected, '#', after, else, clause, (if, statement, already, closed). We used '#', after else clause. The error message indicates the '#' after else clause is problematic. So we remove that. The fixed code inside triple backticks: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
We output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
