Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". The error message just "syntax error". They want to only use the error message, but we need to produce fixed code.

Original code uses brackets [ ] incorrectly. Probably intended if-else with braces {}. Also extra closing bracket at end. So correct code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also if b = 2 should be inside braces. So final code block.

Let's produce only code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
