Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to close the if properly. The else clause is missing braces or parentheses? Syntax likely: if (...) { ... } else { ... }. Currently else has no braces. Also there's an extra closing brace at end. So we can change else b = 2; to else { b = 2; } and remove the trailing }.

So final code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That is answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
