Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to correct it using only error message, not pre-trained knowledge? The message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So there is an extra ']' after else clause. Also we used brackets instead of braces or parentheses. The correct syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Probably remove the trailing ]. Also bracket usage wrong.

We output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
