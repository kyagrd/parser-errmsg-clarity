Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. We need to fix syntax error using only error message: "syntax error". So we can only use symbols that appear in the error message? The error message is "syntax error". Contains letters: s y n t a x e r r o r. The symbols: letters only, no punctuation except space. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Means we can only use characters that appear in the error message. That includes letters: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o. Space is allowed? The error message has a space between 'syntax' and 'error', so space is allowed. Also the error message might allow underscore? No. So we can only use those characters: letters s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o, plus space.

We need to produce code that has no syntax error and uses only those characters. The original code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The error is an extra '}' at end. Also missing braces after else. We can rewrite using only allowed characters. Since we cannot use symbols like '(' ')' '{' '}' ';' '=' '>' '0' '1' '2', but we must use only allowed characters. That's impossible. Maybe we interpret "symbols that appear in the error message" loosely: Use only those symbols, but we can still include other symbols? Or we can avoid using them? But maybe we can still use other symbols, but we must try to use the ones from error message. But instructions say: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can use those symbols, but not required to only use them. But we cannot use any other symbol not in error message? It says "if available" meaning we can use them, but we may also use other symbols.

However, we cannot output our thinking. Just output the fixed code block. The code likely to be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we need to remove the last extra '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` is wrong. Should be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Thus output that. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
