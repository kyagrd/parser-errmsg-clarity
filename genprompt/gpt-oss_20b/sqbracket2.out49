Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Looks like braces mismatched: maybe use [] as block delimiters. Should be: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Remove the stray ] after else clause? The error says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So after else, there's `b = 2; ]` but else expects a block maybe with []? So correct: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. Also close the if? Already closed. That should fix. Output only fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ] 
```
