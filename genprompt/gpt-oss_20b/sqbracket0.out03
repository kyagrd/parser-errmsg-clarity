Thinking...
The user gives error message: syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

They want to fix syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. That is confusing: they want to use only the error message? The error message just says "syntax error". Maybe the instruction is to use only the error message? That is not helpful. But we need to provide fixed code.

We need to fix the syntax error. The original code appears to be maybe JavaScript or some C-like language, but uses square brackets incorrectly. Use curly braces or proper syntax:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Also note there's an extra closing bracket at end. So fix by removing it.

Thus output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```python
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
