Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We have an extra closing brace '}' at the end. Remove it. Also else clause syntax may need braces? But error says else clause already closed? The error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates an extra } after the else. So just remove the final }. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
