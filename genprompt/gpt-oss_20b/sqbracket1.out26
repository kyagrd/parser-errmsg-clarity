Thinking...
We have code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax error using ONLY error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the error is that there's a stray closing bracket after else clause. The code uses brackets `[` `]` instead of braces `{}`. So fix by using proper braces or remove extraneous `]`. We need to use only error message to fix. That means we must not use pre-trained knowledge: but we can still analyze.

Given the error, we need to remove the `]` after the else clause. Also, the `if` syntax requires braces or no braces? In many languages like C, you can do `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` but need semicolons. But the code has `[ a = 1; ]` using brackets. So maybe the original language uses `[]` as block delimiters? But the error says "if statement already closed" meaning that the else has a closing bracket that is extraneous. So we remove that bracket.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But still we have `[ a = 1; ]` maybe fine. But error was only stray bracket. We should output code with the bracket removed.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But we also might need to close the `if` block properly. But the error message suggests that after the else, there's an extra `]`. So removing that will fix.

Thus output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
