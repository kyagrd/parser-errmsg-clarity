Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. Error message: syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```"

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block.

We need to produce corrected code. The code appears to be C-like syntax. The problem: There's an extra '}' at end. Also else missing braces. We should correct to:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, we could write else with braces. So final code should have balanced braces. Provide only that.

We must output only the fixed code block. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Thus that's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
