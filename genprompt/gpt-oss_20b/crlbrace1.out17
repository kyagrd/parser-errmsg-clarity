Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see that there's an extra closing brace '}' at end. Remove it. Also formatting: else clause should have braces or not? It is `else b = 2;` which is fine as single statement, but we need to ensure braces match: open brace after if, close after else statement? Actually if clause: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; So there is one opening '{' and one closing '}'. That matches. The extra '}' is erroneous. So just remove final '}'. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
