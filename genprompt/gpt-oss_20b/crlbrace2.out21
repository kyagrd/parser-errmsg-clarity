Thinking...
We have an error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace at end. So remove last '}'. Also note that else should have braces or not? The code currently else b = 2; But maybe we should add braces: else { b = 2; }.

Given we must only use error message? But we can correct. So produce fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That removes the stray '}'. Output inside triple backticks.

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
