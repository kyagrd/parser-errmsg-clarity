Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We must use only error message and symbols. It says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So else clause not expected after closing. So remove '#' after else? But the else part has '#' at start: "# else b = 2; #". We might need to comment properly. Perhaps we need to use '#' as comment symbol? The error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means that after 'else', there is a '#', which is not allowed because else clause already closed. So we need to remove '#' before else. So code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But then there's trailing '#' at end. Remove trailing '#'. So final: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
However the '@' after condition is weird; maybe it's part of syntax? We keep it. So output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
