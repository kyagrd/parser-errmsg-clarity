Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Looks like an invalid syntax: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. In many languages, `if` expects a block or statement after condition. The `@` is not valid. Maybe they meant `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The comment `#` used as comment start? In many languages like Python `#` comment, but `if` syntax is different. If it's JavaScript: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` no. The syntax error message is generic.

But the instructions: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we should deduce from error message "syntax error". Not enough. But we can guess they want to remove the `@` and the stray `#`. Provide correct code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or if want braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The simplest: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
