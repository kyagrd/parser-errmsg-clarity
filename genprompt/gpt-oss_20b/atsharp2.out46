Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
The code uses @ perhaps start of block? The error indicates unexpected '# after else clause (if statement already closed)'. So else clause is being seen after it's closed. The code currently: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

We likely need to move the '#' to before else or remove it. The error says after else clause, maybe the '#' is after the else keyword or after the if block? The code has 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #'. The '#' after the 'else b = 2;' might be considered after else clause, but the else clause hasn't been closed? Actually, else clause is 'else b = 2;' but it's maybe not closed with a semicolon or block. The '#' after else is unexpected. We need to adjust code to avoid that. Perhaps remove the trailing '#' after else, or place '#' before else. Since error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we can remove the trailing '#', or comment properly.

Given instructions: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we should only use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message includes "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the '#' symbol appears. We can use '#' for comment? The code uses '#' as comment delimiter? The language may use '#' for comments. So we need to place '#' after something else? But we need to fix syntax. The simplest fix: Remove the stray '#' after the else clause. So code becomes:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But that may need semicolon after else. The code has semicolon after b = 2;. So we remove trailing '#'.

Thus final code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But we might also need a space between if block? It's unclear. The original had `@ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Maybe the '@' indicates start of block? Then we need closing `@`. But we don't have that. The code is weird. But the error indicates after else clause the if statement already closed. So maybe the else clause is inside the @ block but the block is closed before else? Hard to know. But likely we just remove the '#' after else.

Thus output the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
