Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses Chinese brackets 《》. Also if syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` but parentheses wrong? Should be `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Actually assignment statements need semicolons. So code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But maybe need curly braces? Not required. Just change brackets. So final answer inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
