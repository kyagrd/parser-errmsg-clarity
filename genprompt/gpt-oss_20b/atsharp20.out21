Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #'. They mention syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message is just "syntax error". We need to produce fixed code inside triple backquote code block. We can't output any explanation. We need to fix using only symbols that appear in the error message? The error message "syntax error" includes letters s,y,n,t,a,x, e,r,r,o,r. We cannot use any other symbols? They say "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Means we can use only characters that appear in the error message. The error message has letters: s y n t a x e r o. But the code uses parentheses, @, a, =, etc. Perhaps we need to replace the problematic syntax. The code is: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The syntax error likely due to '@' being invalid, and the comment syntax (#). Maybe we need to replace with 'syntax' letters. But we can only use symbols from error message, which are letters. We can replace '@' with 's' maybe? And remove '#'? Use only letters? The instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we can't rely on knowledge that '@' is invalid, we only have the error message "syntax error". We can only use symbols that appear in error message. That is a tricky puzzle. So we can use letters from the message. The code has letters already. The only problematic symbol is '@' and '#'. We need to replace them with symbols that appear in the error message. '#', '@' are not in error message. So we need to replace them with something else, maybe 's'? For example: if (x > 0) s a = 1; s else b = 2; s. But 's' alone not a comment, but maybe syntax doesn't care. But they didn't say language. But they want a syntax error fixed. The code must compile? Not specified. Probably just remove '@' and '#' and replace with something else like a space or nothing. We can use letters: 's' or 't' etc. Let's propose: if (x > 0) s a = 1; s else b = 2; s. But that might be still wrong. Alternatively, we can use 'x' to comment out? Not clear. Maybe just remove the comment markers and '@' like:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

This would be a correct syntax in many languages. But '#' and '@' removed. The instruction to use symbols that appear in error message. 'if', 'x', 'a', 'b', 'else' are letters all in error message? 'i','f','x','a','b','e','l','s','t','y','n','o','r'? 'b' is not in error message. So maybe can't use 'b'. But we can use 'x', 'a', 'e', 'l', 's', 't', 'y', 'n', 'o', 'r', 'i', 'f'. 'b' not in message. But 'b' is used originally. Maybe we can rename variable 'b' to 't'? So code:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else t = 2;

This uses only letters from error message? 't' yes. 'e','l','s','e' are letters. So that's fine. So we can use 't' instead of 'b'.

Also, we need to handle the '@' and '#'. Remove them. So final code:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else t = 2;

Wrap in triple backticks. No extra output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else t = 2;
```
