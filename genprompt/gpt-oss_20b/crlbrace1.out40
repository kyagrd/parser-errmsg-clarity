Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to correct it: The extra '}' at the end. Also else statement syntax: else must be followed by a block or a single statement. They wrote else b = 2; That's okay but missing braces maybe. They should use else { b = 2; } But still the error is from unmatched '}'. So we can remove the trailing '}'. But the error message says if statement already closed. So we can modify to:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
We could keep else b = 2; but better to add braces. Also remove trailing '}'. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Return that.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
