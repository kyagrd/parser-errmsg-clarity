Thinking...
We have an error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we can still logically think. The error says unexpected ']' after else clause. There's an extra closing bracket after the else statement. So we need to remove that extra ']' at the end. Also perhaps we need to close the if block. The code uses square brackets as block delimiters. So the structure: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The else part has no brackets. The final ']' is extra. So fix: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. Also maybe need semicolon after else? The error message says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So removing that bracket resolves. Let's produce fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Return only that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
