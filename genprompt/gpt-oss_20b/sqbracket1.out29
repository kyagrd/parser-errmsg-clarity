Thinking...
We have a code snippet with an error: `unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)`. We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we can interpret: The code currently:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We want to produce valid syntax. The error indicates there's an unexpected ']' after else clause, and if statement already closed. That suggests we had a stray bracket. In many languages like C, C++, Java, you'd write:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

So we need to replace brackets with braces. Also remove stray closing bracket at end. Provide only fixed code block. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We should preserve semicolons. In C-style languages, we need braces. So answer: triple backticks with code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
