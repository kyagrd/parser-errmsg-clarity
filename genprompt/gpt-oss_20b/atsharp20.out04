Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message: "syntax error". So we only have that. We can't use pre-trained knowledge? The instruction says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must only rely on the error message. The error message is generic. We can't know what syntax is expected. But we can guess: The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Perhaps the `@` symbol is wrong. Use colon or braces? Use `:`? We need to produce a syntactically correct code. But we don't know language. But we can attempt to use typical if syntax: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Remove @ and #. So the fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That seems fine.

But maybe they want to keep some structure: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` The error is syntax error. The easiest fix is to remove `@` and `#`. Provide: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
