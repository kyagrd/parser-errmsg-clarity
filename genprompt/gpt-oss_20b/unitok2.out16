Thinking...
We need to produce corrected code. Original uses symbols 《 and 》 around code blocks. There's an if statement: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》 The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the last 》 after else is causing problem. Maybe we need to remove it or adjust. The syntax maybe that statements inside are enclosed by 《 》. For if block we have condition then 《 a = 1; 》. Then else block should also have 《 ... 》? Currently else b = 2; 》 - only the end bracket after else. Should be else 《 b = 2; 》. Also after the entire if-else maybe no trailing 》. So corrected code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. Probably that's it. Provide code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
