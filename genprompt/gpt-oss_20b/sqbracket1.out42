Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. We see code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We have stray brackets. Probably intended:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
or in C? Use braces. Also remove stray closing ]. So final code block: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Return that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
