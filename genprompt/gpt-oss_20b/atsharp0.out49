Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error, only using the error message. But basically we can fix code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

There is syntax error due to @ symbol, # comments? Actually # used for comments in some languages but not C. The code likely is C-like: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Also # else b = 2; # seems to have hash comments. We need to produce fixed code. So:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe they need braces? For single statement if else. In C, need semicolons. So output code inside triple backquote. Ensure only code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
