Thinking...
We have error message: "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They used some non-standard brackets 《 》 which is like Chinese bracket? That is causing syntax error. The correct syntax in most languages (probably C-like) would be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively include braces: `{ a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

But we only have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, no pre-trained knowledge. That means we rely on error message "syntax error". We must replace 《 and 》 with standard brackets or remove them.

The code block should output fixed code inside triple backticks.

Probably they want:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Or with braces. But they didn't use braces originally. So simplest: remove 《 and 》. The "else" part has no braces either. That is syntactically valid: a = 1; else b = 2; Wait that's not valid because you need an if statement body before else? Actually in C-like languages, you need a statement after if, then else followed by a statement. So you can have:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That is valid. So just remove the special brackets.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wrap in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
