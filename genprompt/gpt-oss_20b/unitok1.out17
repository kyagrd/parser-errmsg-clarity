Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters instead of braces? So correct code: use if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Make sure the code block is just that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
