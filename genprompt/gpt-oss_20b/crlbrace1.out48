Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we have an extra closing brace '}' at end. Remove it. Also note else clause syntax: else b = 2; is okay in some languages? In C/C++ else must be followed by statement; `b = 2;` is a statement. So fine. The if block is closed before else, so else has no block; but that's okay.

Thus fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return that code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
