Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on pre-trained knowledge? But we can use the error message. The error says: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So there's an extra closing brace after else clause. The correct code: remove the stray '}'. Also else needs braces if there's more than one statement. For single statement, it's okay. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Thus output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
