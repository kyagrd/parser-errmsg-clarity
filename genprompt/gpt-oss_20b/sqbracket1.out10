Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: code snippet has if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ].

We need to use only the error message, but basically we need to correct the syntax. Use proper curly braces or parentheses. The error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there's an extra ']' after else. Also, the syntax of if in many languages: if (condition) { statements } else { statements }. Or if (condition) a = 1; else b = 2; That's fine. But the snippet used square brackets [ ] instead of curly braces. And also has mismatched brackets. So we need to produce corrected code. Likely:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the instruction: Output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote. So just output that code. We'll produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need to be careful to close braces. Or we could also use semicolons.

Ok.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
