Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses Chinese brackets `《` `》` incorrectly. The correct syntax likely is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the prompt says "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only see error message: "syntax error". But we need to output the fixed code. But they instruct to fix syntax error. We might assume the code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

We output that in triple backticks.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Make sure no extra spaces. We'll output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
