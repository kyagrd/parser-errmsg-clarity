Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

They say the syntax may be different from existing languages. We need to fix using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message mentions ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely the closing bracket after else is unexpected. The code currently has unmatched brackets: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ] . There's a closing ']' after else's statement. That should be removed. Also the else part syntax maybe `else [ b = 2; ]`? But the original uses else b = 2; with a semicolon, then a closing bracket. It says syntax may be different. We just need to fix the error: remove the trailing ']'. But also maybe need to close the if block properly: after `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That seems balanced: if opens with [, closed after a = 1;], else clause is `b = 2;` (no brackets). Then we have an extra ']' at the end. So removing that should fix. The final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
