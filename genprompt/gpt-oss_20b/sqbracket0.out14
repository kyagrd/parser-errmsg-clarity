Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. But we have code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. We need correct syntax. Probably meant to be C-like: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } Maybe remove stray brackets. Also trailing ]. Let's produce fixed code.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
