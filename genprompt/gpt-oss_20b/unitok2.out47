Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). In code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. It uses 《 to start block? Maybe the code intends to open a block after if, close with 》, then else clause should have a block but they closed already? We need to remove the extra closing bracket at end after else clause? The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So after else b = 2; 》 there's an extra 》. So we should remove that. Also we need to ensure opening brackets match. Code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;` That should be fine? But maybe the else block also needs its own 《 and 》? Not necessary. They had a trailing 》. So fix: remove the last `》`. Let's produce the fixed code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
