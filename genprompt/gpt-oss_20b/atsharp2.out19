Thinking...
We have an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to fix the syntax error, using only the error message (i.e., we should use symbols that appear in the error message). The error message says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates that the '#' after the else clause is unexpected, maybe stray. The code has "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". It seems the code uses '@' maybe as a separator? The else is after the '#', so maybe the '#' prematurely closed the if? The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Actually the '#' after else b=2; # is maybe after the else? Let's parse: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". So the code has '#' after the assignment of a=1. That might terminate the if block? The else is after '#', so it's not attached to the if. Then the second '#' at end is stray. The error message indicates that after the else clause the '#' is unexpected. So the solution: Remove the stray '#' after the else. Also maybe remove the first '#', or change it to something else. But we are told to fix using symbols that appear in the error message. The error message contains: unexpected '#', else clause, if statement already closed. We can only use symbols present in error message: '#', else, if. Possibly we could replace '@' with something else? The '@' is not mentioned in error message. But we might keep '@' if it's part of syntax. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we should keep only '#', else, if. But we might need to use the error message's symbols to indicate the fix.

We can remove the stray '#' after else, so code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`. But still there is a '#' before else. That may also be unexpected. But the error message indicates the error after else, not before. But maybe the '#' before else prematurely ends the if. But the if statement is closed by '@'? I'm not sure. However the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot assume knowledge of the language syntax. But we can fix by removing the stray '#' after else, because that's flagged by error. Let's produce fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

But maybe we need to close the if with a closing symbol, like ')'? Already closed by ')'. The '@' might be something else. But we can't rely. We'll provide the corrected code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
