Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix using only the error message. The error message indicates there's an unexpected ']' after else clause, and that if statement already closed. The code has mismatched brackets. It uses square brackets instead of curly braces. Also there's an extra closing bracket at the end. The correct code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Or if using minimal braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)" So we should remove the stray ']' and close with proper braces.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
