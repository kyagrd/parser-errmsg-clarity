Thinking...
The user says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." They provided the error message: "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

This appears to be using wrong brackets. The correct syntax in many languages like C/C++/JavaScript would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, if they want to keep single line but using parentheses? Should be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But original has weird 《 and 》 characters. So we need to replace them with proper braces or semicolons. The syntax error is caused by those characters. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Which one is expected? They might want braces. Since original had multiple statements inside, but only one. We can use braces to group the statements. So the fixed code: 

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's likely the simplest. Provide only the fixed code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
