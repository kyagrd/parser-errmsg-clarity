Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error. The code uses nonstandard brackets "《" and "》". The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). They want only the fixed code block. They mention syntax may differ from existing languages, so we need to keep using these brackets but correct. Likely they need to close else properly: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》? The error says after else clause (if statement already closed). They had: else b = 2; 》. They closed the if statement before else? The original: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. The "else b = 2;" is not enclosed within brackets? The final "》" is after else. The parser expects else statement inside "《》" block. So we need to change else b = 2; 》 to 《b = 2; 》. So code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》.

Also maybe need semicolons and spaces. So output the fixed code.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
