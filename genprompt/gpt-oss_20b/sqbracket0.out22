Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
It looks like a mix of JavaScript or C syntax. The error message: syntax error. We should fix it using only the error message. The error message is generic, but we can assume it's in a language like JavaScript. The syntax for if statement is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Also there's an extra ']' at the end, remove it. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
We should output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Ok.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
