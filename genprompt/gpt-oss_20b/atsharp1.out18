Thinking...
We have an error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. So we need to interpret that error indicates there's a '#' after else clause and the if statement already closed. That means the else clause might be incorrectly placed: The '#' after else may be considered as part of code but the else is not allowed after 'if' closed? The code uses '@ a = 1;' which seems like some syntax error? It may be from some language. But we only need to fix the syntax error.

So we can change the code to:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on knowledge of syntax of typical languages. Only using error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). That indicates there is a '#' after else clause. The else clause is not needed because the if statement is already closed. So we can remove '#' and maybe also remove else b=2? But maybe we need to add else clause properly. But we can't add else because else clause is flagged as error. But we can interpret that else is not necessary, we can just have the if part. Or else part should be after else, but we can't have '#' after else.

Simplest fix: remove the '#' characters and keep the code inside if. That might produce: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. But still the else may cause error because else not needed. But we don't know.

Maybe we can just remove the else altogether. But the error says else clause already closed. So we can just delete the else part.

So final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`.

But also there is `@` which is weird. But we cannot use pre-trained knowledge. So we only fix the syntax error: remove '#' after else clause. That would give: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`? No we removed the '# after else clause'. Actually we remove the '#' before else: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2; #`. But still we have '#' at end. That might still error. So we need to remove the '#' completely: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That might still cause error but not about '#'.

Alternatively maybe we need to comment properly: The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. So maybe the code had `else b = 2; #` but the '#' is considered after else clause. So we need to remove the trailing '#'.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`.

We don't have more context. The instruction says "Fix the syntax error ... using ONLY the error message". So we should produce the fixed code. Let's produce the code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
