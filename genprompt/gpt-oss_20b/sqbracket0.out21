Thinking...
The user wants us to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge. This seems contradictory: We need to fix the syntax error, but we are only allowed to use the error message. The error message is "syntax error". But we need to produce the corrected code. We must output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. So we must produce code that compiles.

The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Probably the intended code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The error: mismatched brackets and missing braces. Also the else clause incorrectly placed. The correct code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively if using single statements, then:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But we need to fix the syntax error. Use braces. So final output:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

We output only this code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
