Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Error message: syntax error. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we need to rely only on the error message "syntax error" to guess what's wrong? That seems impossible. But maybe they want to use the error message to identify the wrong symbol? The error message is generic. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" includes no symbols. So maybe they want to use the syntax to correct: replace [ ] with { }? Typically in languages, if you have if statement with curly braces. But the code uses brackets [ ]. The mismatched bracket at the end: there's an extra ]. Also else missing braces. They want to fix syntax error. So we can rewrite as:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we cannot assume braces are the correct syntax. The original used brackets [ ]. We could keep that. We need to correct mismatched bracket. So we can replace the closing bracket after else with ]. The code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So we need to close the if block with a bracket and else block with bracket? Actually the code uses `[ a = 1; ]` which is fine. Then `else b = 2; ]` is wrong: there is an extra ]. We can remove that. So the corrected code could be:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But maybe the syntax requires braces around else body. But instruction says we can use symbols that appear in the error message if available. The error message has no symbols. So maybe they expect to use the bracket as the only symbol to close else block. But we need to close it. There is no opening bracket for else. But maybe we can do `else [ b = 2; ]`. That would add an opening bracket. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

We need to ensure balanced brackets. That's probably what they want: remove the stray bracket and add missing opening bracket for else. So final code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. This has no syntax errors. So output that inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
