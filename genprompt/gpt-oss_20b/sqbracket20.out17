Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message "syntax error" and symbols that appear in the error message. The error message only contains "syntax error". So only symbols available are the letters s y n t a x e r r o r? Actually the message is "syntax error". That includes letters, space. We can use those symbols. The code uses brackets [ ]. We need to produce a correct syntax. Possibly change brackets to parentheses? But we can't use symbols not in error message. Only allowed symbols are those that appear in error message: "syntax error" letters s,y,n,t,a,x, space, e,r,o. Also maybe punctuation? There's space. So we can use only letters, maybe we can produce "syntax error" as code. But we need to fix code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. We can replace brackets with parentheses? '(' and ')' not in error message, so cannot. We can use braces? '{' '}' not allowed. We can use only letters and space. But that seems impossible. Maybe we can just rewrite code using words from error message: "syntax error". For instance: if (x > 0) syntax error else syntax error. But syntax error is the error message itself; but using it as code may cause no error? Probably we can use 'syntax' as variable? But 'syntax' and 'error' are words.

We need to produce a syntactically correct code snippet using only characters present in error message. The error message "syntax error" contains: s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o and space. Also maybe we can use newline? Probably not.

We can produce code: if (x > 0) syntax error else error. But 'if', 'else' use letters i,f. 'if' contains i not allowed. So can't use 'if' or 'else'.

Maybe we can drop the 'if' statement and produce a simple expression: syntax error. But we need to output fixed code. Could be just 'syntax error' which is the message itself. But that would be not a syntax error. Actually "syntax error" is just a string. That may be acceptable? But the instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That implies we need to use the error message to fix the syntax. We may need to replace brackets with something that appears in error message, like '()' not allowed. But maybe we can replace brackets with 's' or 't' or 'a'? That would be nonsense.

Maybe we can output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But we need to remove the stray ']' at end. That would be minimal. The code had an extra ']' after else b = 2;]. Removing that gives:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But still uses brackets. But maybe the syntax error was due to stray bracket. Removing it fixes. That uses only ']'? The error message didn't help. But we can fix by removing stray bracket. That uses ']' present in code, not error message.

The instruction says use ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. But we can still output fixed code. Possibly they expect minimal fix: remove stray bracket. So output the fixed code. Let's do that.
...done thinking.
