Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax error. Observed: There is an unmatched closing brace '}'. We have opening brace after if: { a=1; }, and else branch doesn't have braces. The code has one extra closing brace at the end. Also else part maybe missing braces. The syntax error message just says "syntax error". We should output corrected code. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we should rely only on error message. But we can use logic: error message "syntax error" indicates problem. But we can fix by removing stray closing brace. Also maybe else part missing braces but it's okay if else b = 2; is fine. So fixed code: remove trailing '}'. Also maybe remove the else missing braces? but it's okay. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's it. Provide inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
