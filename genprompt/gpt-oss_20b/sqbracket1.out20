Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: Unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to produce correct code. The error message says that there's an unexpected ']' after else clause, since if statement already closed. In many languages (C-like), you use braces {} for blocks. Here it's using brackets [], which are wrong. So we need to change brackets to curly braces or semicolons. The code could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also remove stray closing bracket. So output the fixed code inside triple backticks. Ensure only that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
