Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace at the end. Should remove it. Also else syntax: in many languages, else block needs braces or statement. Currently `else b = 2;` is fine. So just remove trailing `}`. Also parentheses correct. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. Should we add semicolon? It's okay. Output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
