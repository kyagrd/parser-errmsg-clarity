Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Observations: mismatched brackets. The `if` should have matching braces or parentheses. There's an unmatched `]` at end. Possibly we need to replace brackets with braces? The error message says "syntax error". They want to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains "syntax error". No symbols.

We need to produce a fixed code. They say "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we just need to fix syntax: maybe replace `[` with `{` and `]` with `}`? And fix the extra bracket at end.

Original: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

We can change to:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But original has no braces for else. Also there's an extra `]` at end. Let's produce:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But we need to close else? Might be okay.

We should output only fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus answer:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's likely fine.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
