Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The issue: There is an extra closing brace '}' after the else. The else clause missing braces around b = 2; Should either have braces or remove the extra '}'. The simplest fix: remove the last '}'. Also maybe else should be else { b = 2; }. Let's use braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } Remove the extra '}'. That yields balanced braces. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

We output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Let's produce.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
