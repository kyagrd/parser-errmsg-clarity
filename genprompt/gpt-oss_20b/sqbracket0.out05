Thinking...
We have a syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

We need to fix syntax. The code seems like C or similar. Use parentheses and braces properly. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also remove stray bracket at end. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Probably that's it. Ensure no extra brackets. Output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
