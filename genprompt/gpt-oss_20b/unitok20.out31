Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. We must only use error message? "syntax error" - no specific info. They say use symbols that appear in error message if available. But error message is just "syntax error". No symbols. So we cannot use special symbols.

They mention the syntax may be different from existing languages. The code given: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Looks like maybe using 《 and 》 as braces? They used them incorrectly. There is an unmatched closing at end? Let's examine: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. There is opening 《 before a = 1; then closing 》 after. Then else b = 2; then a closing 》 again but no opening. So missing an opening before else maybe.

So we need to correct syntax. Possibly they intended to use 《 to open and 》 to close blocks. So we could change to:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
That matches openings and closings. So final code inside triple backticks.

We should not output reasoning.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```
