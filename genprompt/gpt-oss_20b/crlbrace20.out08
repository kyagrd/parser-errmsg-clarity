Thinking...
We have a code snippet: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The syntax error presumably due to unmatched braces. There's an opening brace after `if (x > 0) {`, and closing after `} else b = 2; }`. Actually we have opening `{` and closing `}` before `else`, then after `else b = 2;` there's an extra `}`. Also else block missing braces. The syntax likely intended: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So we need to remove the stray `}` at the end and add `{}` around else. Let's produce fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Use triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
