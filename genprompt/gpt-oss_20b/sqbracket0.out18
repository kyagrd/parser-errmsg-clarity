Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses if with brackets [ ] instead of braces {}. Also mismatched brackets at end. Should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the requirement: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we only know error message "syntax error". But we still can fix. Provide only fixed code in triple backquote. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That is the corrected code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
