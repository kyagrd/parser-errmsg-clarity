Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Syntax error. We need to fix using only error message. Error message only says "syntax error". No further guidance. We must use symbols that appear in error message, if available. The error message has "syntax error" words, no symbols. But we must output the fixed code inside triple backticks. We should correct the code, presumably in some language-like style. But the note says "the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we need to fix it using symbols that appear in the error message. The error message only has letters. But maybe the rule is we can't use any other symbols than those in error message? That seems impossible. Maybe we can just remove the syntax error: close brackets properly.

Original code has unmatched square brackets: [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ] . There are 3 opening [ and 2 closing ]. Actually: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. There is an opening [ after condition, then a statement, then a closing ], then else, then a statement, then ; then a closing ]. That final ] is mismatched. We can remove the final ]. So code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that still might be syntax error because of the square brackets. But maybe that's allowed. The note says the syntax may be different. So just remove the stray ].

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

We must output only that inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
