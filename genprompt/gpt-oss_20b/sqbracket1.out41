Thinking...
We have an error: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
The syntax appears to be wrong: using square brackets instead of braces. Also the final ']' after else is unmatched. The correct code presumably: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But the request: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we must only use the error message to infer the change. The error message says unexpected ']' after else clause, if statement already closed. So we need to remove that last ']'. Also we need to adjust the opening '[' for the 'if' clause? Possibly also the closing ']' after 'a = 1;'? The error says the ']' after else clause is unexpected because if statement already closed. That suggests the '[' after if and the ']' after else cause the statement to be closed early. So remove the trailing ']' after else. So code becomes:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
But that still uses '[' ']' incorrectly. But maybe the language is some pseudocode where '[' ']' denote blocks? But typical languages like C use braces. The error mentions 'if statement already closed', meaning that the ']' after else indicates a closing bracket of a block that was already closed. The language might be Python? No. In Python you'd use colons and indentation. Not this.

Maybe it's the language where '[]' denote code blocks. In that case the syntax could be:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
The error says "unexpected ']' after else clause". That suggests there's an extra ']' after else. Indeed we have 'else b = 2; ]'. So the ']' after else is unexpected. So we need to close the 'if' block properly before else. That means we need to place ']' after the 'if' block and before 'else'. So the correct code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
But the original had no '[' after else. So we need to add '[' after else. Also remove the extra ']' after else? Wait we already added '[' after else, but we keep the ']' after b = 2; This yields: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. The trailing ']' after else block is correct.

But the error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The ']' after else clause maybe referring to the trailing ']' after else? That means the ']' after else clause is causing issue. But we need to place a ']' after 'else' block. The problem is that the ']' after else is considered closing the 'if' block prematurely. So we need to move that ']' after 'else' block? Actually the code has: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So there's no '[' before else; thus the 'else' is not part of a block, causing the ']' after else to be mismatched. The correct syntax likely: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. So yes.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

We can output that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
