Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
This seems like some programming language with if statement. The error message says unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). They used '#' to comment? They wrote else but with '#' after else clause maybe wrong.

Probably the code intends:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

The '#' characters were used incorrectly as comment start but placed after else causing error. So remove '#'.

Also there's '@' after if (x > 0) ?. Maybe that is a syntax error too. Should be if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

We just output fixed code.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Return code only.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
