Thinking...
We have a code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
The error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So we need to fix syntax error using only error message. The code might use square brackets for blocks instead of braces. The structure likely: if (condition) [ ... ] else [ ... ]. The closing bracket after else is causing error. So remove the stray ']' after else clause, but we need to add an opening bracket before else content. Let's rewrite:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```

Check: The code uses if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]. That seems balanced. The error was unexpected ']' after else clause; we removed that. We need to keep only fixed code.

Thus output code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
```
