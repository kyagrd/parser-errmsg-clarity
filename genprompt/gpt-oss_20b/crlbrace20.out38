Thinking...
We have a user prompt: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

Error message: "syntax error"

Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The code syntax may be different from existing languages. We need to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message only contains "syntax error". It contains no symbols.

The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Since error message has no symbols, we can't use that. So we just need to fix the syntax error.

Given code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

We need to balance braces. There's an extra closing brace. Also else clause syntax. In many languages, else must be followed by a block or statement. We currently have else b = 2; which is okay in C-like if else but missing braces around else block. But the main error is the unmatched brace at the end. Remove the trailing }.

So fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But maybe we need braces around else: else { b = 2; }.

But the syntax error might be due to the stray } at end. So we fix by removing the extra }. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But check: The else clause is correct. In C, else b = 2; is fine. But to be safe, we can enclose it: else { b = 2; }. But either is okay. The minimal change: remove trailing }.

The instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So we don't know exact language. But we can assume a generic if-else. The stray } is likely the error.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
