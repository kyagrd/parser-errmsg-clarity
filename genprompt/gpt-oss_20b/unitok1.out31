Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses Chinese brackets 《》 as tokens incorrectly. Should be if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }? But error says else clause after if already closed. So the first '》' after a = 1; indicates closing bracket incorrectly. So we replace 《 with { and 》 with } accordingly. Also the trailing '》' after else b = 2; is an error. Should close the block. So final:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We need output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
