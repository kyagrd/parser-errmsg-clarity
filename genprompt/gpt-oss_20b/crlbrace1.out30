Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace after the else. The correct syntax is: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The else clause can either have braces or just statement; but we have else b = 2; but there's an extra } at the end. Should remove the last '}' or add braces correctly. We can just remove the last '}' to match the open braces. But the error indicates if statement already closed, meaning we opened an if block with `{` and closed it before else. So else should not have an extra } after it. So we should remove the trailing '}'. So correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But maybe they want to add braces around else for clarity: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But the error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely we need to delete the '}' after else. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But maybe they want proper code. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we must use only the error message to deduce fix. The message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove that extra '}'. So answer: fixed code with no extra '}'. Provide only the code in triple backticks. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
