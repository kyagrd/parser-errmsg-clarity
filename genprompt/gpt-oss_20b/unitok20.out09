Thinking...
We have a code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The syntax error likely due to using wrong brackets: "《" and "》" instead of parentheses or braces. They appear like Chinese punctuation. Error message just says syntax error, but we can only use symbols that appear in error message, but error message contains only "syntax error". So we can't use special characters? But we can use brackets that appear in error message? Actually the instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" contains the words syntax and error. No symbols. So can't use special characters like Chinese brackets. So maybe we can replace them with something standard like parentheses and curly braces.

The code appears to have if (x > 0) then a = 1; else b = 2;

We need to wrap body statements in something: maybe parentheses or curly braces. In C-like languages, we can do:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we are told the syntax may be different from existing languages. But using curly braces is common.

Thus the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we might not need braces for single statements, but we can keep them.

Thus output the code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
