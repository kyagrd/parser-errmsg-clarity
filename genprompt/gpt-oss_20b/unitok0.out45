Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses some nonstandard characters: 《 and 》 used like braces. They should be replaced with braces {}. Also if statement syntax: if (condition) statement else statement. So fix to:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also we might need to close braces accordingly. The current code ends with 》 after else block. So final: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

We only need to output the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
