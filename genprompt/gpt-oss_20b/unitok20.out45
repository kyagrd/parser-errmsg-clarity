Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code uses Chinese brackets 《 》 as delimiters? It says "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages". Use symbols that appear in error message, which is "syntax error". So we can't use any special knowledge; only use the error message. The error message only says "syntax error". No symbols. So we must not use any symbol that is not present in the error message? This is ambiguous. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message is just "syntax error". It contains no symbols. So we cannot use any symbol? That seems impossible. Perhaps they mean we should use only characters that appear in the error message? "syntax error" includes letters s y n t a x e r r o r. So we can only use letters from that phrase? We need to produce fixed code. Maybe we can rewrite code with only those letters. The code originally: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. We need to produce a syntactically correct version using only allowed characters. The error message "syntax error" includes letters: s y n t a x e r o. We can use parentheses? Not in error message. So we cannot use '(' or ')' etc. So perhaps we need to produce code like: if x then a=1 else b=2. But 'if', 'then', 'else', etc contain letters from allowed set: i f t h e n e l s e. Wait 'i' not in allowed set. So can't.

Maybe we need to output the same code but with missing closing brackets? No, need to fix syntax.

Maybe we can just output the code but remove the Chinese brackets, using parentheses? But parentheses not allowed.

However the instructions: "NOTE the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages." So we could interpret the language uses 《》 as delimiters for statements. The syntax error maybe because the closing brackets are wrong. The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. It has an opening 《 after if condition, then a =1; 》, then else b = 2; 》. The error likely due to an extra closing bracket after else block. So fix by removing last '》'. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; This uses parentheses and semicolons, but those were present originally. So we didn't add any new symbols; we only removed one. That should be acceptable. But they say "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message "syntax error" includes 'syntax', but no parentheses or semicolons. So we didn't add any new symbols, we removed one. So maybe it's fine.

But maybe we need to output code inside triple backquotes exactly. Provide fixed code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; No trailing bracket. I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
