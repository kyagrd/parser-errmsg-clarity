Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

We must use symbols that appear in error message: ']' and maybe else clause. The code uses square brackets instead of braces. The closing ']' after else seems unexpected. The code has mismatched brackets: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. The correct syntax likely would be: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. But the error says the else clause is already closed, so remove the stray ']' at end. So final: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` But maybe need brackets around else body too: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. The error message: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means there's a ']' after else but the else is closed. In code, after else there's `b = 2; ]`. So remove the final ']' maybe? That leaves `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That still might be wrong because else body is not bracketed. But if language uses brackets for blocks? Possibly syntax is like `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. That would be correct: no stray ]. So answer: show that code.

The instructions: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." No commentary. So output the fixed code.

Given we want to use only error message symbols: ']' appears. We used ']' in both sides. Let's produce code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]`. That uses the error message symbol ']' and removes stray. That seems good. I'll output that.
...done thinking.

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]
