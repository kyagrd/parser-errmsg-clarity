Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. They say syntax may be different from existing languages. Use only the error message (syntax error). But we can use symbols from error message? The error message is just "syntax error". We can use symbols like @, #? They are currently causing syntax error. We need to correct syntax. Suppose the intended syntax is maybe:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Remove @ and #. So code block:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Yes. Output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
