Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message. The code snippet: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the problem: there's an extra closing brace '}' after the else clause. Remove the extra '}'. Also need to ensure else clause syntax: else b = 2; but braces? The original code had else b = 2; maybe else should be 'else { b = 2; }'. But the error message only mentions the extra '}'. The code may be language-agnostic. We'll fix by removing the trailing '}'. So corrected code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But maybe also need braces after else? But not required if it's a single statement. The error message indicates that the '}' is unexpected after else clause, meaning after else clause the statement ends, but there's an extra '}'. So we just remove it. Provide final code block.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 
```
