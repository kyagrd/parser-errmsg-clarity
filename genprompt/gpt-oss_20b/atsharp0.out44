Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The error message is generic: "syntax error". We can't use pre-trained knowledge; must use only the error message? They want to fix syntax error using only error message? But we just need to produce correct code.

Original code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

It seems like a mix of languages: maybe C-like syntax with `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The `@` and `#` are likely erroneous. To correct, we need a proper if statement. Perhaps:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But maybe they want a simple one-liner: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` That's a valid C syntax. So we need to remove the `@` and `#`. The code inside triple backticks.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Probably that.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
