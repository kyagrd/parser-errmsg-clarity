Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error using only the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge. That means we can only look at the error message "syntax error" and maybe the code. We have to produce the fixed code.

Original code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`

The issue is unusual bracket symbols: 《 and 》 instead of braces or parentheses. In Python, `if` syntax is: `if x > 0: a = 1 else: b = 2`. In C, `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

But we must only fix the syntax error. The error message is "syntax error". The code seems to be from C or maybe a C-like language. The code uses parentheses correctly for the condition. But uses weird symbols `《` and `》`. So we need to replace them with braces `{` `}`. Also need semicolon after the else block. The code as given: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. Actually there are three `》` at the end? It ends with a single `》` after `b = 2; 》`. So likely the syntax error is the use of wrong brackets.

Thus corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

Alternatively in Python: `if x > 0: a = 1 else: b = 2`. But that would need colon. But the code uses parentheses so probably C. So output the corrected code inside triple backquotes.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
