Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code snippet: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Looks like it's some language like Java/C/C++. The `@` after if is wrong. Should be something like `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. The `#` comments are like C++ preprocessor? They should be removed or replaced with `//`. So corrected code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Or if they wanted comments: `if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;`. But the code originally had `# else b = 2; #` meaning comment. So we can remove them. Provide code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
