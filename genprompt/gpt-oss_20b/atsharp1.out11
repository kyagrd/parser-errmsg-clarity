Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause. Code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
We need to produce fixed code. Also "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." But we can still produce fixed code. Let's analyze: The code likely uses Ruby? The syntax: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause. So after else there's '#', causing syntax error. So we need to remove the '#' after else clause. Or maybe the else clause is commented incorrectly. The line has `# else b = 2; #`. It seems the comment start with `#` then else then comment continues? In Ruby, '#' starts comment to end of line. So the line is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The first `#` starts comment: "else b = 2; #". So else part is commented out, but Ruby still expects `else` after `if`. But comment removes else, so parser sees `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` then nothing else. It's okay? Actually Ruby requires `end` to close if. But no else. The comment might be okay? The parser sees "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;" then comment then newline. It expects `end`. But we didn't provide. So error "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)" maybe from other language. But anyway we need to produce code without syntax error. So we can remove comment or properly comment. Let's produce:

```
if x > 0
  a = 1
else
  b = 2
end
```

That should fix. Output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```ruby
if x > 0
  a = 1
else
  b = 2
end
```
