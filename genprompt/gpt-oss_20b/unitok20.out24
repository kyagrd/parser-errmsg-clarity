Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. Error message: "syntax error". That gives no specifics. We must use symbols that appear in the error message. The message "syntax error" contains letters s, y, n, t, a, x, space, e, r, o. So we can only use these characters? The instructions: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use those symbols? Not exactly; maybe we should only use those characters that appear in the error message to produce the fix. The code uses `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. There are mismatched brackets: `《` and `》` used incorrectly. Also missing braces. But the instruction says we cannot use pre-trained knowledge; but we can use the error message to fix? That seems weird. We need to produce corrected code.

We could change the syntax to use parentheses and curly braces? But curly braces are not in the error message. Only use symbols that appear in error message. That means we can use letters, spaces, maybe digits? The code currently uses `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. The '《' and '》' are likely wrong; we might replace them with `(` and `)`? But `(` and `)` not in error message. But we can maybe use `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. That removes the brackets. But that might not be proper syntax but maybe acceptable in some pseudo-language. Use only characters from error message? That includes `s y n t a x e r o` and space. But the code uses `if` and `else`, `x`, `>`, `0`, `=`; these characters are not in error message. The instruction says: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe we should use the same symbols (the angle brackets) but not mismatched. Wait, maybe the code uses `《 a = 1; 》` and then `》` at the end. So there is an extra `》`. We can close the if block properly: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《b = 2; 》`. That uses only those characters and may fix the syntax error. But the error message "syntax error" is generic; but we can use the same symbols. The instruction "without using pre-trained knowledge" means we can't rely on knowledge of languages; but we can modify the code to be more consistent. The simplest: replace the closing bracket after the else part. The code had `else b = 2; 》`. That should be `else 《b = 2; 》`. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《b = 2; 》 
```

But maybe we need newline. The code block inside triple backquotes. We should output only the fixed code. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《b = 2; 》 
```
