Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There is an extra closing brace. The correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That should fix syntax error. Output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
