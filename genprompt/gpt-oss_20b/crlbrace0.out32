Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, but we cannot use pre-trained knowledge? That seems weird. We have to output the fixed code. The code given:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see mismatched braces: if block has opening brace after condition, then close brace after a=1; then else b = 2; then an extra closing brace. In C-like syntax, else must have braces or not: else b=2; is fine but we need to remove the extra closing brace. So the fixed code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, we could use braces around else: else { b = 2; }. But simplest is remove the trailing brace. So output that.

The instruction: "Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block." So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
