Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. There's an extra closing brace at end. Also missing braces around else block? The correct syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or remove braces. Since else part without braces is allowed but then need semicolon after else. Current code: `else b = 2; }`. The stray '}' after else should be removed or matched with an opening. So either add a '{' before else or remove the '}'. Let's produce corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That is typical.

We output only fixed code inside triple backquotes.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
