Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in code using only error message? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we need to base fix only on error message: "syntax error". But we still need to produce corrected code.

Original code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to interpret what language? It looks like C-like syntax. The code has '@' which is incorrect. Also comments use '#', maybe it's Python? But 'if (x > 0)' with parentheses and semicolons indicates C. In C, you can't use '# else', that comment syntax is wrong. So maybe it's pseudo code mixing.

But the error message "syntax error" indicates a generic syntax error. We need to provide fixed code. I think we want to fix to a correct C statement: 
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

So we produce code in triple backticks.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. So:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
