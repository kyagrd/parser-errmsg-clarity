Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. We need to output fixed code inside triple backquote. Use only the error message? We can't use pre-trained knowledge? The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." We must rely solely on the error message "syntax error". But we cannot refer to pre-trained knowledge. But we still can reason? Possibly they want minimal fix: replace @ with =? Or correct if statement. The syntax likely C or Java. Should be: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. So output: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
That's it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
