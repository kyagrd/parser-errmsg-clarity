Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error in code: "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }". There's an extra closing brace at the end. Also maybe the else block missing braces? But that's okay; else b = 2; is fine. So remove last }.

The fixed code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`

Return only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
