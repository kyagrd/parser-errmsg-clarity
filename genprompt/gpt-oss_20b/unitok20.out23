Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. They used 《 and 》 as delimiters? It seems syntax uses those as some braces. But error message "syntax error". We need to fix using only the error message? Not sure. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is weird. They say use only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. So we can't use our knowledge of languages. We only have error message "syntax error". But maybe they mean we can only use the symbol that appear in error message? But error message only says "syntax error". No symbols. Huh.

Alternatively maybe they want to fix the code by using correct syntax: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That uses curly braces. But the code uses 《 and 》 as brackets. Could be the language uses 《 to start block and 》 to end. Then else? The code had mismatched brackets: after else there's `b = 2; 》` but missing a starting delimiter. Also after first block there is `> 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. Actually it has opening 《 before a, closing 》 after a. Then else b = 2; 》. There is an extra 》 at end? The else part doesn't have opening delimiter, just closing 》. So syntax error. To fix, maybe add 《 before b. So code: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. That matches pairs. Also maybe need to close the final block. That code has matched: open 《 after else, close at end. Should we close final 》? Already present. So fix by adding 《 before b. That uses only symbols appearing in code, not error message. They said "using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." The error message has none. But we can use code's own symbols. So answer likely: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》`. Let's output only fixed code inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
