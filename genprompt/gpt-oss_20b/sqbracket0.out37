Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using only the error message: "syntax error". We can't use pre-trained knowledge? That seems contradictory: we must only use the error message, but we can still reason? It says "without using the pre-trained knowledge." This might be a trick: we are to deduce the fix solely from the error message? But we can analyze the code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]` This has mismatched brackets. The correct syntax in many languages would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe the language uses `[ ]` for blocks? Probably it's incorrect. The error message is just "syntax error". We can fix by replacing `[` with `{` and removing stray `]`.

We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But if it's Python? Actually Python doesn't use parentheses for if; it's `if x > 0:`. But the original uses `if (x > 0)` which is C-like. So correct for C/C++/Java etc. So yes.

But we need to keep the same language semantics? The user didn't specify language. Let's choose C-like. So output fixed code.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
