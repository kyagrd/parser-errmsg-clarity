Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

It seems there's stray '#' characters. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. Maybe the '#' should be removed. Also there's an '@' symbol after condition maybe it's part of assignment? The code probably intends: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; The '@' is maybe a typo. So fix: remove '#' and '@'. So code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We output only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
