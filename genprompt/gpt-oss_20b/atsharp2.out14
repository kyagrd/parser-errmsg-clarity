Thinking...
We have code: 
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
Error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). We must fix using only the error message. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause. It might mean that the else clause has already been closed? Or that there's a stray '#' after else clause? So we need to remove the '#', but the code may be language-agnostic. They mention that syntax may be different from existing languages. We must only use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. The error message includes "unexpected", "after", "else", "clause", "if", "statement", "already", "closed". It also includes "unexpected", but not 'if'. We can use #? They said use symbols that appear in error message if available. # appears in the code but not error message. But we can remove it. So we need to produce fixed code. Perhaps the code should be:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
We need to remove the stray '#' at the end. Also remove the '#' after else? There's one after the if statement: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. So remove both '#'. So final:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
That's likely.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
