Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error. They want to use only the error message, but that's ambiguous. But we should output the fixed code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Looks like they used Chinese brackets 《 》 instead of braces or parentheses. In C-like syntax, should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But maybe the original is JavaScript or Python? In Python if you want to do single-line then you'd use colon. But they used parentheses. This looks like a C/C++/Java style. So use braces.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

We output only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
