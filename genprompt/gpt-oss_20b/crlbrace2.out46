Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

So there is an extra closing brace after the else statement. Also maybe else should have braces or not. The syntax may be like C-like but also maybe Python-like? It says syntax may be DIFFERENT from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in error message, if available. So we need to remove the extra '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` But maybe the else statement also needs braces if following syntax requires. But error says unexpected '}' after else clause, meaning else already closed. So just remove that last brace. So final code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

We output only code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
