Thinking...
We have code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). There's an extra '}' at end. Also else clause is incorrectly formatted: else should have braces or statement: else b = 2; is okay without braces? In JavaScript, else b = 2; is okay but missing braces but should be else { b = 2; } maybe. The error indicates extra '}'. So remove the trailing '}'. Also, maybe missing braces around else if we want. But using the error message only: Unexpected '}' after else clause. So just remove trailing brace.

Fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But we might want braces around else block: else { b = 2; } else b = 2; is okay but still extra '}'. We'll fix as: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Better to include braces for clarity. The error is just extra }. So remove it.

Hence final code block.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
