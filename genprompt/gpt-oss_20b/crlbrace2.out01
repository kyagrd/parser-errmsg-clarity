Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There is an extra '}' at the end. Also else clause missing braces or statement? In languages like C, else b=2; is valid but curly braces not needed. But there's an extra '}'. So remove the last }. Also ensure braces matching: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; That's correct. Provide fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
