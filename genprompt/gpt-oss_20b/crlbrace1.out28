Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The error: extra closing brace after else clause. The if statement already closed. So we should remove the last `}`. Also else syntax: `else b = 2;` is missing braces if we want to assign inside else. But it's syntactically allowed: `else b = 2;` is okay if you want to assign. But we may want to wrap in braces for clarity. However the instruction: "Fix the syntax error ... using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge." So just fix syntax. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe we want to keep braces for else too: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The error message indicates only unexpected '}' after else clause, meaning extra '}'. The code had one extra '}'. So we remove it. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. That is syntactically correct. Alternatively if we want braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That also correct. But we must output fixed code inside triple backticks. We'll choose with braces for else for clarity. But either is fine. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's fixed.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
