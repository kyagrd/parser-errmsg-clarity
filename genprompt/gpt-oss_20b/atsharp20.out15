Thinking...
We need to produce fixed code. The original code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Syntax error. They ask to use only the error message, but we cannot use pre-trained knowledge. But we can guess? The syntax error could be due to `@` instead of something else. We need to produce a code that is syntactically correct. Since syntax may be different from existing languages. They want to use symbols that appear in the error message. Error message: "syntax error". Only symbols present: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o. But we can maybe use 'if' with parentheses. The code might be something like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But use only error message symbols? They said use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. That would be s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o. But they don't restrict the use of other symbols? They say: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can use symbols from the error message: maybe we can replace `@` with something else like `:`? But colon not in error message. But we can use `#`? Not in error message. But they said "if available" meaning we can use those symbols if we need. But we might not need to strictly use only them. But we can.

Original error: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

So we could change `@` to `{` and add closing `}`. But braces not in error message. However, we can use `else` is present. The # characters maybe comment. So we can do:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That's valid in C? `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` would be fine. The `else` is part of same statement. But if we need braces, we can omit. The original had semicolons after each assignment. That is fine. The error maybe due to `@` and comments `#`. So removing them fixes syntax.

Thus final code: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

We must output only the code inside triple backticks. Let's do that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
