Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We must use only the error message, which says "syntax error". But also use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message contains just the words "syntax error" - no symbols. So we cannot use any special symbols? The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Since error message has no special symbols, we can use normal syntax. But the original code uses 《 and 》 brackets, perhaps intended as some syntax for an unknown language. We need to fix to a valid syntax. We can replace them with braces or parentheses. The structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. Probably intended to be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But we need to keep only the syntax of the code above may be different from existing languages. But we can choose to replace 《 with { and 》 with }. There's an extra 》 at end of else clause? Actually the code ends with 》 after else b = 2; 》. There's an extra closing bracket.

Maybe the intended syntax: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. So the original had 》 after the else, but missing opening bracket. We can fix by adding opening 《 before else block: else 《 b = 2; 》.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

That uses only the symbols 《 and 》. So the syntax error would be fixed. Let's output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
