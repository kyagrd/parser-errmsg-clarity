Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Provided code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Means there's an extra closing brace after else. The else part should be a statement or block. We have `else b = 2; }`. So extra `}`. Should remove it. Also else clause syntax: should be `else { b = 2; }`. Could also be `else b = 2;`. Both are acceptable. The simplest: remove the last `}` and add a block? The error: after else clause, we have `}`. The if statement already closed earlier after first block. The else clause expects a statement; we gave `b = 2;` then a `}`. So we should either remove the extra `}` or add a block around `else`. Let's propose corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This is minimal fix.

Return only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
