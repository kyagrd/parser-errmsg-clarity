Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. We are told to fix syntax error using only the error message? The error message is just "syntax error". So no symbols. But we must still fix syntax. The code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` There's an extra closing brace at the end. Also else missing braces. So we could close properly. Suppose we remove extra '}'. So code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. But if the language requires braces for else block? But we can keep as is. The error is extra '}'. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`. We must output inside triple backticks.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
