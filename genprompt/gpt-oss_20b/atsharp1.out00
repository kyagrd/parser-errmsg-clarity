Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code has an if with a condition, then uses '@' instead of 'then', likely syntax error, and then a '#' comment after a semicolon, but the else clause is commented out incorrectly. We need to produce fixed code. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on pre-trained knowledge. Use the error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the '#' after else clause. The else clause is not present; we need to correct the code. The code: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #. Likely they intended: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }. Or something like that.

We have to output only the fixed code inside triple backquotes. Use minimal changes. Remove the '#' and fix the syntax. The '@' might be a mistake; maybe it's supposed to be a 'then' or curly braces. The code is likely in some language like JavaScript or PHP? In PHP, if syntax: if ($x > 0) { $a = 1; } else { $b = 2; }. The '@' symbol is error suppression operator in PHP, but here it's used incorrectly. So remove '@'.

Thus corrected code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`.

We need to output only that. Let's do that.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
