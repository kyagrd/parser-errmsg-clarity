Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see mismatched braces: there is a closing brace after else part that doesn't have matching opening. Probably intended to have braces around else block. The syntax error arises due to stray '}'. Also else clause missing braces.

The correct code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Also we might need to ensure variable types. But we just correct syntax. So output only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
