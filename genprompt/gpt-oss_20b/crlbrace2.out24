Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We see an extra closing brace at the end. Also else clause missing braces. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the extraneous '}'. Also ensure else block syntax maybe should have braces. Could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the original else didn't have braces, just `else b = 2;`. If we keep that, we need to remove the last '}'. So:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But that would be syntactically correct. The error says unexpected '}' after else clause, meaning that the if statement already closed before the extra '}'. So we fix by removing the last '}'. Provide fixed code. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." But we have to output the fixed code. It says note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from existing languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available. So we use the error message: unexpected '}' after else clause. So we remove that '}'. Provide final code block. No extra commentary. Let's produce the fixed code: maybe best to use braces after else to group, but not required. The error message indicates a syntax error due to extra '}'. So just remove it. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But the code ends with a semicolon after else b=2. That might be fine. Provide only the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
