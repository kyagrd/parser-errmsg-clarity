Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error only using error message? It's a weird instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That is contradictory. The error message is just "syntax error". But we are asked to fix the syntax error in the code. The code uses some weird brackets "《" and "》" and missing semicolons. Likely they want to replace 《 with `{` and 》 with `}`? Also need to place semicolons appropriately. The correct C-like syntax would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But missing braces around else block? Actually else can be just single statement: `else b = 2;`. So that is fine.

Alternatively, if they want curly braces for both. Probably:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But not necessary. But we need to fix syntax. The error message "syntax error" indicates invalid characters. So use correct braces.

Let's output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But to be safe, include else block braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Either one is correct. Which one is likely? The original had `else b = 2;` which is fine. So let's output with braces for if only. I'll output with braces.

So final answer: triple backticks code block with fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
