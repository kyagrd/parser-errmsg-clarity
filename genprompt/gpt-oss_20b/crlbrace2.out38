Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

There is an extra closing brace '}' after the else. Remove it. Also braces around else block? The else is not block but single statement; allowed. So code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; 

But maybe they want braces around else: else { b = 2; } . But error says unexpected '}' after else clause (if already closed). So just remove the extra '}'. Provide fixed code.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Check if any other errors: maybe missing semicolon after else statement? In code it's b = 2; that's fine. So final.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
