Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This appears to be some language like C-like but with error. The `@` symbol is not valid. Also comments `# else b = 2; #` may be a comment. It might be intended to be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

But still the comment syntax (#) is not valid in C. But we can use C-style comments `// else b = 2;`. But the instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That means we need to use the error message alone to guess? The error message says "syntax error" with no details. We can't rely on knowledge of languages? But we must fix the code. We can guess that the code should be in some language that uses `if` and `#` comments? Possibly a shell script: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Shell uses `if` statements like `if [ $x -gt 0 ]; then`. But here we have `if (x > 0)`. That's not shell. The `@` maybe part of a language like Perl? But in Perl, `@` is array variable prefix. This code is invalid.

Maybe the language is C#? C# uses `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. The comment with # is not used; it's `//` or `/* */`. So the code seems erroneous.

The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." This is a puzzle: we have to fix the syntax using only the error message. The error message is just "syntax error" without details. That doesn't help. But maybe we are to remove the problematic symbol '@' and the stray semicolons or comments. Let's propose a minimal fix: remove the @ and use braces or semicolons properly. Let's produce:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```

But that is still missing braces for if statement in many languages. But maybe the language is JavaScript: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. In JavaScript, `if (x > 0) a = 1;` is valid if `a` is a variable. But `@` is invalid. So we can simply delete the @. And the comment `# else b = 2; #` is not a comment in JS; it's just stray code. But it might be purposely commented out with #. But we can't treat it as comment. The code would be `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`? But the `else` part is missing? Actually the code had `# else b = 2; #`. So maybe the `#` indicates comment; we can keep it as comment. But it's not recognized by many languages. But the instruction might be to only modify to fix syntax. So we can just remove the `@` and the stray comment markers. Provide code:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But that still has semicolon after else? Actually `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` is valid in JavaScript? The else must follow if without semicolon: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` This would parse? Let's check: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` In JS, semicolon after if statement might prematurely terminate the if. So we need no semicolon after `if` part. So we could write:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But in JS, you can't have `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` because the semicolon after `if` ends the statement, leaving `else` unpaired. The correct is `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` Actually no, the semicolon after `a = 1` is fine, but there should be no semicolon between `if (x > 0)` and the statement. Let's restructure:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

That's valid.

But the error message only says syntax error, so maybe the minimal fix is to remove the '@' and any stray semicolons or comments. But maybe we should not add braces? It's ambiguous. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we cannot rely on knowledge of syntax, but we must produce fixed code. But we have to guess.

Let's assume it's a C-style language. The minimal fix: remove the @ and use braces.

So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But there is no variable declaration. We'll keep `a` and `b` as variables. This is a plausible fix.

Let's output inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
