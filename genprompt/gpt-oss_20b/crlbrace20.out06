Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's mismatched braces: opening "if (" and then { after condition. Then else b = 2; but no braces. Then an extra } at end. Also else missing braces. Also else clause is missing a block. We can adjust: else { b = 2; } Remove extra } at end. So final code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } That's it.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote block.

No extra explanation.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
