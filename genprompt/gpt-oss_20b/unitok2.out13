Thinking...
We have an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

They want to fix syntax using only error message, without pre-trained knowledge. They say code syntax may differ, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available.

So we need to output the fixed code inside triple backquotes. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely the '》' are some punctuation used instead of braces or something. The code uses 《 and 》 maybe like block delimiters. The syntax appears like:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

They likely want to close the if block with 》 after else? Actually the else should be part of the if statement. Maybe the correct syntax: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》? But they have an extra 》 at the end. Let's parse:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

We have if (x > 0) then a = 1 inside 《》, then else followed by b = 2; then a trailing 》. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the if statement is considered closed before the trailing 》, so we shouldn't have it. So maybe remove the trailing 》. So the corrected code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;  

But the trailing 》 might be meant to close the else block? But else doesn't have block? The error suggests else clause already closed. So we remove trailing 》. But maybe we need to add block for else: else 《 b = 2; 》. The trailing 》 might close the else block, but it's after else clause, but the if is closed earlier? Actually after if's block, we close it with 》. Then else b = 2; 》. The error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the 》 after else clause is unexpected. So we need to move that 》 before else, or remove. But the syntax of the language might allow block after else? Might be like: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. So we should rewrite as that. The code had else b = 2; 》. So we want else 《 b = 2; 》. So remove the extra 》 after else clause, and add a block. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》. That seems likely. Let's produce that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》
```
