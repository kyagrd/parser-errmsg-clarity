Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message. The error message says "syntax error". No more detail. Code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

We have weird delimiters "《" and "》". Also after else missing brackets. Also final "》" maybe stray.

We should use only symbols that appear in error message? The error message only says "syntax error" no symbols. We need to fix using the error message, but we can use any symbols. The prompt: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." Only error message is 'syntax error'. Contains characters: s y n t a x space e r r o r. So we can use letters: s, y, n, t, a, x, e, r, o. But we can just produce correct code: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But we need to keep maybe using these letters? We can just output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That uses only letters a, b, etc. It's fine. Output only code block.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
