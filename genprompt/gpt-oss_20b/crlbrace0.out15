Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only error message? We have error message "syntax error". We need to output fixed code only inside triple backticks. We need to find the syntax error in code: "if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }". The braces: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There's an extra closing brace. Also else branch lacks braces but can be a single statement. Should be: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; // no extra }.

Also missing semicolons? It's fine. So correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; Probably also close else with braces? But simplest: remove trailing }.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That's the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
