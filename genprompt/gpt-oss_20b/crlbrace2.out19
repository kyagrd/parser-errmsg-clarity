Thinking...
We need to produce the fixed code. The code snippet:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code likely missing braces around else body. The correct should be: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also remove extra closing brace at end. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. They want code inside triple backticks.

Output only that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
