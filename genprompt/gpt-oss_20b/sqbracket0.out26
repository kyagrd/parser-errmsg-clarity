Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message? "syntax error" is not helpful. But we can just provide a fixed code. The code has an if with parentheses but uses brackets for block. In Python, if expects a colon and indentation. But it's probably JavaScript? It uses parentheses for condition and braces for block. But uses square brackets incorrectly. Also mismatched brackets. The correct code in JavaScript: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
If Python: 
```
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
Given the original uses parentheses and semicolons, likely JavaScript. Provide fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
