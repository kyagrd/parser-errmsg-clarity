Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error in code using ONLY the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. They provided error message: "syntax error". We need to correct code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The code has mismatched braces: There's an extra closing brace at the end. Also else block missing braces. It could be: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That would be correct. They said only use error message? They want only the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. So output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the original had an extra `}` at the end. So we need to remove it. Also we could add braces for else. So final code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Ensure it's a single line.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That is the only output.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
