Thinking...
We need to produce only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The error message is just "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

We need to fix the syntax error. Let's analyze the code. It's likely missing braces or mismatched braces. The code is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. The `else` clause should have a block or statement; here it's `b = 2;`. That's fine: `else b = 2;` is allowed in many languages if the statement is a single assignment. But there's an extra closing brace `}` at the end. So remove the trailing `}`. Also might need braces around else, but not necessary. The code might be missing a closing brace for the if block? Actually the if has `{ a = 1; }` which is closed. Then else clause has `b = 2;` and then there's a stray `}`. So we fix by removing that stray `}`. So the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But maybe the else part also needs braces for consistency: `else { b = 2; }`. But that's optional. The original code had else b = 2; so I'll keep that.

Thus final answer: triple backticks and the fixed code.

Also note that the instruction says: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." That seems contradictory because we are using our knowledge. But we just need to output the fixed code. The only error message provided is "syntax error". But we can still produce the fixed code. The instructions also: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe we need to use the symbol "syntax error" which contains letters. But no, the instruction says "using symbols that appear in the error message". The error message is "syntax error". The symbols are s,y,n,a,t,x, etc. But not necessary.

We just output fixed code.

Thus final.
...done thinking.
