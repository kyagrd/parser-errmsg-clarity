Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error in the code using only the error message. The error message is generic "syntax error". The code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. Let's analyze.

The code seems like C-like syntax. The '@' is likely error. Also '# else b = 2; #' maybe comment. In C, # is preprocessor directive. They used # to comment maybe. Instead we can use // comment. The 'if (x > 0)' then the statement. We can write:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```

But the else part is commented. Might want to maintain else? But the original had else comment. So we remove '@', replace with no operator. The syntax: if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2; But they want to comment else. Use // else b = 2; But maybe they want to keep the else? However the code has else inside comments. So I'd change to:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```

Make sure there is no trailing spaces. That's fixed. Or we can do:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```

Yes. Provide only code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; // else b = 2;
```
