Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Original code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The issue: uses brackets instead of braces. Also unmatched bracket at end. Should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively could be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But correct typical syntax: else block also needs braces if multiple statements; but just one statement can be without braces. But given error, fix: replace [ with {, ] with }, remove stray ]. So final: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Also ensure no stray bracket. So produce code block.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
