Thinking...
We have to fix the syntax error using only the error message, without pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to remove or adjust the stray '}'. The else clause is `else b = 2;` but after that we have a '}' that is not matched. So we should remove the last '}'. So the fixed code would be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
We need to output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backticks. No commentary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
