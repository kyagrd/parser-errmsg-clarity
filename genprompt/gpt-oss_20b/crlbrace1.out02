Thinking...
The user wants to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, but we need to provide corrected code. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } There is an extra closing brace after else clause. The corrected code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } Or remove the extra brace. Actually proper: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; } So provide code inside triple backquotes.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
