Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error using ONLY the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. But I have knowledge. But instruction: "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." But I cannot interpret that. I think it's a constraint for me as ChatGPT: to rely only on the error message to infer the fix. But I have general knowledge, but they want to use the error message. The error message says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the syntax error is that the code uses Chinese brackets 《 and 》 incorrectly. We need to replace them with proper braces {} or maybe parentheses. The original code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the last '》' is unexpected. So we need to remove it or replace with appropriate bracket. The structure: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

So we need to replace 《 with { and 》 with }.

Thus the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Return only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

Thus:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

But also ensure else clause: else { b = 2; } is valid. But it's okay. But if we use else b = 2; it's also fine. So final answer.

...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
