Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

It seems like mismatched brackets: we have an opening square bracket before a = 1; but we close with ] after else. The structure might be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But there's an extra ] at the end. Maybe we need to remove the final ]. Or adjust brackets: maybe else b = 2; should be inside brackets. The error message: syntax error. We should correct the code. Possibly correct syntax is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ]

Or change to parentheses? But we are told that syntax may be different from existing languages. Use symbols that appear in error message if available. Error message: "syntax error". That includes word 'syntax' but not symbols. The code uses parentheses and brackets. So we should correct bracket mismatches.

The original has opening parenthesis for if, and closing after condition. Then a bracket '[' before a=1, then ']' after a=1; Then else b=2; then an extra ']' at end. So we remove the extra ']' at end. So fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But that still has mismatched? Let's check: 'if (x > 0)' then '[' 'a = 1;' ']' else 'b = 2;' So it is consistent. Maybe no syntax error. But maybe the language expects brackets around both blocks. But given the error, remove the trailing ']'. So final code is as above.

But maybe we need to add missing brackets around else block: 'else [ b = 2; ]' Then no trailing bracket. Which is better? The error might be due to the stray ']' after b=2;. So we remove it.

Thus final answer: inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
