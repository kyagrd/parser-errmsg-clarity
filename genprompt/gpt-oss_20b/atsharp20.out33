Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

We can use only symbols that appear in the error message? error message: "syntax error". So symbols: 's','y','n','t','a','x','e','r' maybe spaces, punctuation? But we likely just need to output corrected code. The instruction: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we can only rely on error message "syntax error" maybe we can use the word 'syntax'? Might need to use symbols that appear in the error message. They say "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So we can only use characters that appear in "syntax error": s y n t a x e r o? Actually "syntax error" includes letters s,y,n,t,a,x, space, e,r,o. So allowed characters: s y n t a x e r o and space. Possibly punctuation? The error message "syntax error" contains a space. No punctuation. So we cannot use '@', '#', ';', parentheses, etc. That would violate. So we must rewrite code using only allowed characters.

But also code likely is in a language where syntax might be: if condition then statements else. But we only allowed characters: s,y,n,t,a,x,e,r,o,space. We can attempt to form a correct expression with only these. Eg "if x > 0 then a = 1 else b = 2" but we cannot use >, =, etc. So impossible.

Maybe the instruction means we can use any symbols but only refer to error message? Actually "using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." Means we can't recall syntax of languages; we only have the error message. But we can still output corrected code? The error message is generic, so can't deduce. The instruction might be trick. Perhaps the fix is to remove the stray symbols: '@' and '#' comments. So correct code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But we need to keep syntax of language: maybe use curly braces. But instruction: "NOTE the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages". So we can use same symbols. So likely they want to remove '@' and '#', leaving a correct syntax. So output:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wrap in triple backticks. This is likely answer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
