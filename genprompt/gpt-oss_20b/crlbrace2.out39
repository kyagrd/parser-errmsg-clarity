Thinking...
We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks. The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We need to fix syntax. The code seems like C-ish. The else clause is missing braces. The extra } at end is wrong. We could close else with braces: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
We remove the stray '}'. So final code: same but with braces. Provide in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
