Thinking...
The user asks: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge."

We must use only the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". They want a fixed code. We need to output only the fixed code inside triple backticks.

We should not mention the analysis. Only the code. Also we cannot use pre-trained knowledge? But we can still fix the code logically. The original code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So likely the correct syntax is: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Or maybe `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. But the error is about unexpected ']' after else clause. We need to close the 'else' block properly. So we remove the stray ']' after else block. So corrected code: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else { b = 2; }`. But still bracket mismatch: open square bracket [ then close with ]. That is okay if it's using bracket syntax for blocks, but typical languages use curly braces. But we cannot use pre-trained knowledge. However the user just said to fix syntax error. So maybe just remove the stray ']' after else. The code becomes: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`. That might be acceptable. But we need to output only code.

Thus output:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

But perhaps they'd expect curly braces. But the error message didn't mention braces. We'll keep original bracket style. So final answer.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
