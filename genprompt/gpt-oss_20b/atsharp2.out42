Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We have some syntax: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). So there is a '#' after else clause? Actually we have else inside comment? `# else b = 2; #` maybe comment syntax? But error says unexpected '#' after else clause (if already closed). Perhaps the '#' after else indicates comment start, but else clause already closed. The error indicates we need to remove '#'. So maybe remove the second '#'. The code may become:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

But still there's a '#' before else? The error mentions after else clause. The else clause is `else b = 2;`. But it's preceded by '#' so maybe comment. The error indicates that after else clause there is a '#', but the if statement already closed. The code shows `# else b = 2; #`. So there's a '#' after else. Remove that. The corrected code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`. However, there might still be an error: the `@` symbol after condition? Not part of known languages, but "@" maybe used for assignment? The syntax maybe: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`. But the question: "Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge." So we only rely on error message to fix. The error message indicates only the unexpected '#' after else clause. So remove the '#'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

But we still have '#' before else. But that's comment? Might not cause error. The error message: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). It indicates that after the else clause, a '#' appears. The else clause is probably `else b = 2;`. After that there's a '#', causing error. So we remove that final '#'. So final code as above.

But maybe the code wants to use comment '#' before else as well? But the error indicates after else clause. So we only remove final '#'.

Thus answer: triple backquote with fixed code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
