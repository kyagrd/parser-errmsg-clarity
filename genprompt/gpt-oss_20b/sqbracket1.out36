Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error using only the error message, not using pre-trained knowledge? Means we should rely on error message to deduce fix. But we can just produce correct code. The code has mismatched brackets. The if statement uses brackets instead of braces. It's "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". We need to close the else block? The correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

Thus output: ```c code block? The original code likely C. Provide fixed code.

We must output ONLY the fixed code inside triple backquote code block. Let's output:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That's all.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
