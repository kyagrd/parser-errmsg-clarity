Thinking...
We have an error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to fix syntax using only the error message. The error mentions unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). The error message implies that '》' is not allowed after else. We need to replace the '》' with appropriate syntax. Perhaps '；' or something else? The code uses unusual symbols. Maybe '》' is used to enclose the body? The code uses '《' before the body and '》' after. The else clause: `else b = 2; 》`. The error says unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). So we need to remove the closing '》' after else? But maybe the else body should be enclosed in 《》 too? The else clause currently is `else b = 2; 》`. Perhaps it should be `else 《b = 2;》`? That might match pattern. But the error specifically points that '》' after else clause is unexpected. So we should remove that '》'. Let's think: The syntax appears to be something like:

if (condition) 《 body1; 》 else 《 body2; 》.

Thus, we should modify code to:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《 b = 2; 》 
```

But the error said the '》' after else clause is unexpected because if statement already closed. Maybe the else clause doesn't need the trailing '》' because it closes the if statement? Wait, the '》' after else may be considered as closing the else? The else block is not closed? Hmm.

Let's parse: The code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》.

We have: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》.

We see that after else there's a semicolon after b=2; then '》'. So maybe the else block should be enclosed in 《》. But here we didn't open a new 《 for else. So the '》' after else is unexpected because it's closing something that hasn't been opened. So we need to open a 《 before else body. So change to: `else 《b = 2;》`. Then remove the trailing '》' at the end. That should fix.

Thus final code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《b = 2;》 
```

Also ensure no trailing characters. That seems correct.

Thus output the fixed code.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else 《b = 2;》 
```
