Thinking...
The user wants to fix the syntax error using only the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. The error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The problem is an extra closing brace after else clause. The code has an extra '}'. The else block missing braces or semicolon. The code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }.

The else clause "else b = 2;" is okay without braces if just one statement. But there's an extra '}'. So to fix: remove the trailing '}'. So final code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Thus output only that code in triple backticks.

No extra explanation.

...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
