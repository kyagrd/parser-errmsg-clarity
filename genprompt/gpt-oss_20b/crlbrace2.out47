Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
We have unmatched braces. The '}' after else clause is extra. Also else should have braces around statement or not? We can fix by removing the last '}'.

Also ensure correct grouping: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But else may require braces? In many languages else needs statement; we can leave as is. So final code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Thus output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
