Thinking...
We have an error: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
We need to fix syntax error using only error message and symbols in message. The error message references ']' after else clause. The code has an extra ']' at the end after else b=2; There is also a '[' after if condition, and matching ']' after a=1;. That seems correct? But maybe the code expects curly braces? But we need to use symbols that appear in error message, such as ']' and '[' maybe. The error message says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). That means the final ']' after else b=2; is unexpected. So we need to remove that last ']' to fix. Also we need to close the else? maybe we need braces? But we can simply remove that extra ']' at the end. The code then: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
But the 'if' already closed after else? Actually we might need to close the if with ']'? The ']' after a=1; is the closing of the if block. The else block maybe also needs ']'? But error message indicates after else clause. So maybe the else block should be surrounded by brackets? But we can keep it as simple as `else [b = 2;]`. But error message says unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code had an else without a block. The final ']' is extraneous. So remove it.

Thus the fixed code: 
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

We output only that.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
