Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Code uses 《 and 》 as delimiters? The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Probably the intention: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But they used 《 and 》 to enclose the code blocks? The else clause already closed? The '》' after else clause: after else b = 2; 》? The else clause is not enclosed? The final 》 is after else b = 2; 》. The error says after else clause (if statement already closed). So maybe the closing '》' after else b = 2; should be removed because the if already closed earlier. So correct code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

But the '》' after else b = 2; is not needed. But we also need to close the if statement? The original has 'if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》' so the '》' at end closes the if but there is already a '》' after a = 1;. So we should remove the last '》'. So the fixed code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

But do we need another '》'? Possibly we need closing after else block too: but else block didn't open a bracket. So no. So final code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

Wrap in triple backticks.

Return only the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
