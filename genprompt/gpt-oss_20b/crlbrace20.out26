Thinking...
We need to produce only fixed code. The error: syntax error. Code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` There's an extra closing brace. Also the else should have block: `else { b = 2; }`. Also the last `}` is extra. So fix: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. Output in triple backticks.

Let's output.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
