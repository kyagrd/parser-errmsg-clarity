Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. Code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

We only can use the error message? "syntax error" only. We must output only fixed code. The original code appears to be in a language like C? 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #' contains invalid '@', and '#' is used as comments but incorrectly. Maybe we should use C syntax:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe the language is C++. So remove @ and # and put else properly. So fixed code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`. Surround with triple backticks. Output only the fixed code.
...done thinking.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
