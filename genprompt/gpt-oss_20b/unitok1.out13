Thinking...
We have to fix syntax error using ONLY the error message, not pre-trained knowledge. Error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the code: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
We need to replace brackets. The original code uses "《" and "》" instead of proper braces. So correct code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }.

Thus output the fixed code in triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
