Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error: unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed). The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. There is `@` after condition? The syntax might be something like: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The error says unexpected '#' after else clause, meaning after else, the '#' is not expected. We should remove the `#` after else. But there is `#` before else, which indicates comment? Actually code uses `#` as comment? The syntax may differ. Maybe `#` is part of else clause? The error indicates that else clause is already closed. Means `# else b = 2; #` might be wrong because the else clause already ended before the '#'?

Simplify: we can just remove the `#` after else and the one before else? But the error says unexpected '#' after else clause. That means the `#` after `else b = 2;` is wrong. But the code had two `#`: one before else and one after. If the language uses `#` as comment indicator, then the comment start `#` before else is fine. The `#` after else is a stray. So we can remove the trailing `#`.

Thus final code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`.

Also maybe the `@` is wrong. But we can't change other symbols. The error only about '#'.

Thus final code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
