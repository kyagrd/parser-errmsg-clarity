Thinking...
We need to fix syntax error. The code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #` Syntax error. The error message is just "syntax error". We must only use error message symbols if available. It says "syntax error" - no symbols. But maybe we can replace `@` with `then` or colon? But we can't use pre-trained knowledge. We must guess. But we need to fix syntax: maybe `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But the instruction: "Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages, such as C, Java, Python, etc." So not necessarily correct in any language. Just need to correct syntax error. Use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. Error message: "syntax error". There are no symbols. So we just produce a fixed version. Let's choose a common syntax: maybe `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. That removes the `@` and comments. Use semicolons. That seems fine.

Return only the fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
