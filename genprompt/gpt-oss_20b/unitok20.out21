Thinking...
We have an error message: "syntax error". We need to fix the code using only the error message, without using pre-trained knowledge. That seems like a puzzle: use symbols that appear in the error message. The error message is "syntax error". The symbols available: letters s y n t a x e r r o r. But also space. Possibly we need to use those symbols to replace the problematic parts.

The code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

It uses unusual brackets 《 》. These might be causing syntax error. We need to replace them with something else. The allowed symbols: those in the error message. The error message doesn't include brackets. So maybe we need to remove the brackets. Use "syntax" and "error" characters. We can replace 《 and 》 with something like `(` and `)`? But parentheses are not in error message. We can use letters s y n t a x e r o. So we can use `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;` but braces {} not in error message. Maybe we can use `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` but brackets [] not in error message. Use the letters: we can use "if (x > 0) [a=1] else b=2;". But no. The only punctuation present in error message: none. So maybe we cannot use any punctuation other than those letters. But we need to produce syntactically correct code. The instruction: "Try to fix the error using symbols that appear in the error message, if available." So maybe we can use "error" string itself to replace brackets? Eg: `if (x > 0) error a = 1; error else b = 2; error` but that is nonsense.

Maybe the intention: The only symbols we can use are letters and space. So we can remove punctuation. The code maybe not need punctuation? Possibly the language uses different syntax, like `if (x > 0) a = 1 else b = 2`? The unusual brackets could be a problem. We might replace them with `:`? Not in error message. So maybe we simply delete them. Code: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;` This uses parentheses which are not in error message but maybe allowed? The instruction says try to use symbols that appear in the error message, if available. It doesn't forbid others. But perhaps we need to keep only those symbols. Not clear.

Given limited time, produce corrected code with standard C-like syntax: 
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
But missing braces for block but okay. I'll output that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
