Thinking...
We need to fix the syntax error. The code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The error: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). The issue: there is an extra '}' at end. The else clause missing braces or incorrectly placed. If we want to fix: remove the stray '}'. Also else clause needs braces or just statement. It currently has else b = 2; no braces. That's fine if single statement. So final code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

No trailing }. Ensure syntax correct. Provide only fixed code inside triple backticks.
...done thinking.

```cpp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
