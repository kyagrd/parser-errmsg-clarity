```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
else 
    # b = 2;
```

Note: I added an explicit `else` keyword and removed the trailing `#` at the end of the line. The original error message suggests that the `#` character is not allowed after the `else` clause, which implies that it's likely a comment syntax that should be used elsewhere in the code.
