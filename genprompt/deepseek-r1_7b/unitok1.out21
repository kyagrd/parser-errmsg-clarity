Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which is part of an if statement already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see parentheses around x > 0, so that's probably correct. Then after closing the parenthesis, there are some characters: 《 and 》. Wait, those symbols look similar to angle brackets but they're actually different Unicode characters—full-width ones instead of half-width.

In programming syntax, especially in languages like Python or JavaScript, we use regular '<' and '>' for if conditions. Using full-width versions might not be recognized correctly by the interpreter because they aren't valid operators. So that's probably why there's an error—it's expecting a closing parenthesis but finds something else instead.

Looking at the code again, after the condition (x > 0), it has 《 which is likely meant to represent '<' or maybe as part of some formatting. Then inside the else block, it's trying to close with 》, and then there's another 》 outside. So perhaps the user used full-width brackets instead of regular ones.

The error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause." That suggests that where an opening bracket was expected (like '<'), a full-width version is present, causing the syntax error.

So the fix should be to replace those full-width angle brackets with regular ones. Let's see:

Original code:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Replacing 《 and 》 with '<' and '>', respectively, we get:

if (x > 0) < a = 1; > else b = 2;

This makes the code valid. The if statement is properly structured, and each block ends correctly.
...done thinking.

The error arises because the code uses full-width angle brackets `《` and `》` instead of regular ones `<` and `>`. To fix this, replace these characters.

```fix
if (x > 0) < a = 1; > else b = 2;
```
