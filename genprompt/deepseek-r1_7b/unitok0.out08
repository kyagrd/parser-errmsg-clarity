Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided the code and an error message saying there's a syntax error. My task is to fix the code using only the information from the error message, without relying on any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's given here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I notice that there are these angle brackets 《 and 》 being used. In programming, angle brackets like < and > are typically used for comparison operators, but here they're using the full-width versions which aren't standard in most languages. Maybe this is a typo or incorrect usage.

The code structure seems to have an if-else statement. Normally, that would look like:

if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

But in the given code, it's written without any curly braces {} and instead uses these 《 and 》 symbols inside the if and else clauses.

So perhaps the intended structure is to have an if condition with a single statement after it, and then an else clause with another statement. But because of the incorrect use of angle brackets, the code isn't parsing correctly, leading to a syntax error.

I think the fix would be to replace the 《 and 》 with regular < and > since they're probably meant as part of the if condition checks. So changing:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

to

if (x < 0) <a = 1;> else <b = 2;>

Wait, but that might not be correct either because in many languages, the if statement doesn't require parentheses around the body unless it's doing something more complex. Maybe the original code was trying to assign a value inside an if-else structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use curly braces for blocks. So maybe the corrected code should have { and } after the if and else clauses.

But considering the error message is just "syntax error," it's likely due to the incorrect brackets. Replacing 《 with < and 》 with > in both places might fix the issue because those are standard comparison operators.

So putting it all together, replacing each 《 with < and each 》 with > should resolve the syntax problem.
...done thinking.

```
if (x < 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
