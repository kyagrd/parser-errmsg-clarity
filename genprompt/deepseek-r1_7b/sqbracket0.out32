Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix the syntax error in this code. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error, and they provided some code. Let me take a look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, okay, let's break it down. I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or Java, if statements have specific structures. The user is probably using an older language or maybe pseudo-code.

Looking at the code: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]"

Wait, there are square brackets here where they shouldn't be. In many languages like JavaScript or Python, square brackets are used for arrays or dictionaries. But inside an if statement? That doesn't make sense.

So the code is trying to do something like: if x is greater than 0, then a equals 1; else b equals 2. But they're using square brackets instead of curly braces which are usually needed in such conditions.

I think the user might be mixing up different syntaxes. Maybe they intended to use an if-else structure with curly braces because that's standard across many languages.

So, removing the square brackets and adding curly braces should fix the syntax error. The corrected code would look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That makes more sense because each condition is properly enclosed with curly braces.
...done thinking.

The original code has an incorrect use of square brackets in place of curly braces, which are required for if-else statements. By replacing the square brackets with curly braces, the syntax error is resolved.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
