Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

And the error message says there's a syntax error. Let me look at this line by line.

First, the if statement: if (x > 0) is fine. Then it has an opening curly brace and inside is a semicolon after assigning a=1. That seems okay because in some languages like C or Java, you have to end with a semicolon. But here, after the assignment, there's just a closing brace for the if block.

Wait, but then there's an else statement without any condition. Oh no, that's the problem. In most programming languages, 'else' must come right after the if statement without any space unless it's part of the same condition using && or || operators.

So in this code, the structure is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in reality, the correct syntax should be either an else clause within the same condition block or an else if. So looking at how the code is written here, it's trying to have both 'if' and 'else' blocks but without a proper structure.

The code has:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

This looks like two separate statements: one for if and one for else. But in reality, the else should be part of the same condition as the if, not a separate statement.

So I think the mistake is that 'else' isn't properly connected to the 'if'. Instead of having it as a separate line after the closing brace, it should be part of the if's condition block. Alternatively, perhaps using && or || operators would make sense here if we want to keep it in one line.

But looking at the code again, maybe the user intended to have an else statement but didn't structure it correctly. So how can I fix this?

One way is to either combine the conditions or properly indent and structure the else clause as part of a compound if-else statement.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using logical operators (&& or ||) after the initial condition would make sense so that 'else' is connected without needing an extra line. But looking at the code, I don't see any operators there, just an else with no condition attached.

So maybe the correct way is to structure it as:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But that's adding braces where they might not be needed if we're using proper syntax. Alternatively, perhaps changing 'else' into something like else if would fix it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the code is written in JavaScript or another language where you can have an else without a condition by mistake, which is invalid. So to fix that, either remove the else part entirely or correctly structure it with a condition using && or ||.

Looking at the original code again:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

This seems like two separate statements because after the if block closes, there's an else statement. That's invalid syntax in most languages where else must be attached to an if with proper structure.

So perhaps the correct way is to either combine them into one condition using && or || or properly structure the else as part of a multi-line conditional.

Alternatively, maybe just removing the else and having it inside the same block would work, but that's not likely because you can't have multiple assignments in an if block without proper control structures.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the code is trying to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But I'm not sure why it was written as two separate statements. Alternatively, maybe using logical operators to combine conditions so that 'else' is part of the same condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial code has an extra closing brace or missing one, but looking at the code provided, the else isn't properly connected to any block.

Wait, another idea: in some languages like JavaScript, you can write:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else if (y>5) { ... }

But that's different. So maybe I need to adjust the structure so that 'else' is attached correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be an if-else with one condition but it's written in two lines incorrectly.

Wait, looking at the original code again: 

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

I think the issue is that 'else' isn't part of any block because after the first if block closes, there's an else statement. So to fix this, I should remove the else and have it inside the same condition or structure the else correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps using logical operators would help, so instead of having two separate statements, combine them into one line with && or ||.

For example:

if (x > 0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But that's still invalid because else needs to be part of an if statement. So maybe the correct way is to structure it as:

if (x>0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

Which would fix the syntax by properly enclosing the else in its own block.

So, putting it all together, I'll adjust the code so that the else is inside its own block with proper braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
