Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and then showed the code that's supposed to be fixed. Let me try to understand what's wrong here.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
And the output should be only the corrected code inside triple backticks.

First, I'll read through the code carefully. It starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. That looks okay so far. Then it has `[ a = 1; ]` as part of the if block and `else b = 2; ]` for the else case.

Hmm, I know that in programming languages like C or JavaScript, when you have an if statement with braces, the syntax inside is important. Let me check each part.

In the if condition `(x > 0)`, it's correct as long as x is a variable and this is valid code.

Then there's `[ a = 1; ]`. Wait, in many languages, using square brackets like that might not be appropriate unless we're dealing with arrays or something. But here, inside an if block, using [ would start an array literal, but it's not properly closed. The user has `a = 1;` inside the brackets. So maybe they intended to have some code within a block, perhaps a do-while loop?

Wait, looking at the else part: `else b = 2; ]`. Again, using a square bracket here might be causing issues because in an if-else statement, you can't just end with a square bracket. It's probably not valid syntax.

Another thing I notice is that both the if and else blocks have semicolons after their statements, which is correct, but the brackets around them are causing problems.

So maybe the code was intended to use braces {} instead of square brackets [ ] for block delimiters. Braces are more standard in many languages like JavaScript or Java, so replacing those would fix the syntax.

Let me think about how this should look corrected. The if statement would typically have an opening brace at the end of the condition and a closing brace after the body. Similarly, the else clause would follow the same pattern.

So, changing `[` to `{` in both blocks and `}` instead of `]` where necessary should fix the syntax errors.

Let me try reconstructing that:

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

After replacing brackets with braces:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, but looking at the original code again, maybe the user wanted to use square brackets for something else. But in this context, it's more likely that using braces was intended.

Alternatively, perhaps they were trying to write an anonymous function or an array inside the if block, but that seems less common here. Also, since both blocks have semicolons and end with `]`, changing those to braces would make sense.

Another point: The else statement is followed by a semicolon in the original code, which might be incorrect because else doesn't need a body unless it's part of an if-else block without braces. Wait, no, even else can have a body only if you're using curly braces or another structure. But actually, in many languages, if you don't use braces for if statements, the entire statement is treated as a single expression.

Wait, maybe that's not the case here. I think the main issue is the use of square brackets instead of braces. So replacing them should fix it.

So putting it all together, the corrected code would have { and } around each block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
