Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that there's an extra closing brace at the end. The if statement starts with `{` and ends with `}` for its condition. Then, the else clause is on the same line as the closing brace of the if. But then there's another `}` which doesn't belong because it's outside the else.

Wait, no. Actually, in this code, after the if block closes with `}`, the else statement is written immediately after without a new line. So the structure is:

if (...) { ... } else ...

But the else is attached to the if condition without being indented or on a new line, which might be causing an issue. Or perhaps it's just that there's an extra closing brace at the end.

Looking again, the code has two curly braces after the else: one for the if statement and another after else. So maybe the problem is that the second `}` is not needed because the else doesn't have its own block yet.

Wait, no. The else should be part of the if statement's body. So perhaps the user intended to write:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But in their code, after the if block closes with `}`, they wrote an else followed by another `}` which is causing the error because there's no matching opening brace for that last one.

So the solution would be to add curly braces around the else statement so that it becomes a separate block. That way, each statement (if and else) has its own block with its own braces.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to have both if and else without any body, but that's unlikely because you need statements inside them.

Wait, looking again: in their code, after `}` for the if condition, they wrote `else b=2; }`. So the `else` is attached directly after the if block. That might not be correct syntax because the else should have its own body, which requires curly braces.

So to fix this, I should wrap the else statement in curly braces so that it's a separate block. Let me adjust the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
