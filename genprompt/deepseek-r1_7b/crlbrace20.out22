Thinking...
Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the syntax error in the given code snippet. The user mentioned a syntax error occurred when they tried running this code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Looking at it step by step. First, I notice that the if statement is followed by an else clause, but there's no condition between them except for curly braces and semicolons. 

Wait, in most programming languages like C or Java, the syntax after 'else' should have a condition inside parentheses. Here, instead of something like '} else (condition) {', it just has '} else b = 2;'. So that's probably causing the syntax error.

Also, looking at the code structure: the if block ends with }, then there's an else followed by another statement on the next line without braces. That might be part of the problem because each control structure (if, else) should have its own opening and closing curly braces to encapsulate their statements.

So, I think the main issues are:
1. The 'else' is not followed by a condition in parentheses.
2. The code doesn't properly close the if-else block with matching braces.

To fix this, I'll add an empty condition to 'else', like '} else {'. Also, I should ensure that each control structure has its own opening and closing braces for correct syntax.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should have an empty condition after else, and properly enclose everything within braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {} else {};
```
