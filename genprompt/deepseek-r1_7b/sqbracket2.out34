Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me start by reading through the problem again carefully.

The user gave an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The code they provided is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, so looking at this code, I notice that it's written in some kind of programming language or pseudocode because the syntax looks different from common languages like Python, Java, or C. The main issue is probably with the brackets and semicolons.

First, let me break down the code structure line by line. The first part is an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then it's followed by `[ a = 1; ]`, which seems like a block of code inside the if condition. After that, there's an else clause: `else b = 2; ]` and another closing bracket.

Wait, so in the else part, they have a semicolon after `b = 2`, and then another closing bracket `]`. That might be causing the error because brackets are being used incorrectly.

The error message mentions an unexpected ']' after the else clause. So maybe there's an extra closing bracket that doesn't belong there.

Looking at the code again, I think the issue is with how the if-else statement is structured. In many languages, you don't need square brackets around the body of the condition unless it's a block statement. Here, after the `if (x > 0)`, they have `[ a = 1; ]`, which might be unnecessary because it's just one statement.

So perhaps that part should be without the square brackets. Let me try rewriting that line:

Change from `[ a = 1; ]` to `a = 1;`.

Then, looking at the else part: `else b = 2; ]`. The extra closing bracket is probably causing the error because it's after the else statement, which doesn't need another bracket.

So removing the last bracket at the end of that line should fix it. So changing from `else b = 2; ]` to `else b = 2;`.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in some languages, if you have an if-else without any block, just assigning variables is fine. So by removing the brackets and semicolons around them, it should work.

Let me check the error again: unexpected ']' after else clause. In the original code, after `else b = 2;` there's a closing bracket, which isn't needed because it's not part of any block structure in this context. So removing that last bracket should fix the issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
