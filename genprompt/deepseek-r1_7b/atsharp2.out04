Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let's break this down.

Looking at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I notice that there are some lines with `#` at the end. In many programming languages like C or Python, `#` is used to denote comments. So it's common practice to put everything after `#` on a new line as a comment.

But in this case, it seems like they're trying to use these lines as part of an if-else statement. The error message points out that there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause because the if statement is already closed, meaning the else block isn't properly structured.

Wait, maybe the code was intended to have comments within the if and else blocks but was incorrectly placed at the end of each line. So instead of putting them inside, they should be on separate lines as comments for each block.

So, I think the fix is to move those `#` lines above where their respective conditions are so that they correctly comment out the code without breaking the syntax.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```
