Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem carefully.

The code provided is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I notice that there are two lines here: one starts with 'if' and another with '#', which looks like a comment starting with '#' but it's indented. Then, in the second line, after the '#', there's an attempt to write 'else b = 2;' but it seems incomplete.

First, I remember that in many programming languages, if-else statements are written on separate lines without any issues as long as they're correctly indented and structured. However, here, the code is mixed with comments which might be causing confusion.

Looking at the first line: 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1; #'. The '@' symbol isn't something I'm familiar with in standard syntax for if statements. Maybe it's part of a different language or a typo. But according to the user, the code might be from a different language like C, Java, Python, etc., but perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps this is actually using comments and some other syntax. The second line starts with '# else b = 2; #', which seems incomplete because it's just 'else' without an associated block.

I think the main issue here is that the code isn't properly formatted for an if-else statement. The '#' at the end of each line might be indicating a comment, but since they're on separate lines and not part of the code execution, maybe removing them would help.

But in the context of syntax errors, perhaps the '@' symbol is causing an issue because it's unexpected in that position. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write something else there.

Alternatively, considering that the error message was just 'syntax error', perhaps the problem is with how the lines are structured or missing semicolons.

Looking again: The first line ends with ';' which is correct for a statement, but if it's part of an if block, maybe it should be followed by an indented block. But since it's on its own line without any code after the comment, that could cause issues.

Another thought: Maybe each '#' is intended to be a comment, so perhaps they shouldn't be there at all. Or perhaps the lines are meant to be part of an if-else structure but aren't properly indented or closed.

Wait, in some languages like C or Java, you can have comments after keywords for clarity, but here it's written as separate lines with '#' starting each line. Maybe removing those and just having proper indentation would fix the syntax error.

So, I'll try to restructure this. Remove the '#' at the end of each line because they don't belong there if we're not writing comments in that context. Then, ensure that after the 'if' statement, the code is properly indented on a new line without any semicolons or other syntax errors.

Alternatively, perhaps the '@' symbol should be part of an operator or function call, but since it's unclear, maybe removing it and just having the if-else structure would help.

Wait, looking at the error message: it was a standalone code snippet with two lines. The first line starts with 'if', which suggests that the second line is meant to be the else part. But without proper indentation or operators, it's causing an issue.

Putting it all together, I think removing the '#' symbols and properly formatting each statement on its own line with correct indentation would fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code contains a syntax error because the `if` statement and comment are improperly structured. The comments (`#`) should be removed to prevent confusion in the if-else structure.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
```
