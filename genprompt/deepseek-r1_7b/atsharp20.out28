Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code here with a syntax error. The user provided an example where they tried to write some conditionals and assignments but ended up with an error. My task is to fix the syntax without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's in the error message and the code snippet.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I know that in many programming languages, you can't just use an operator like @ to modify variables inside conditionals. In Python, for example, you might see assignments within if statements using colons and indents, but the syntax here looks different.

The error message is a simple "syntax error," which often means there's something wrong with how the code is structured or uses invalid characters. The @ symbol catches my eye because I remember it being used in Python for decorators or maybe matrix multiplication operators elsewhere. But in this context, it doesn't seem right. So perhaps replacing it with an assignment operator like = would fix it.

Also, looking at the lines after the if statement: # else b = 2; #

That looks suspicious. The # symbols are usually used to denote comments, but placing them there might be causing issues. Maybe they should be removed or replaced with proper indentation and line breaks for multi-line statements.

Putting this together, I think the original code is trying to write something like an if-else block where inside the if condition, a variable is assigned 1, and in the else clause, another variable is assigned 2. But because of the @ symbol and the use of # instead of proper indentation or semicolons correctly, it's causing syntax errors.

So, replacing the @ with = to assign the value within the if block makes sense. Also, removing the # symbols and ensuring that each line after the if statement is properly indented so that they're part of the same conditional block. Additionally, adding a semicolon at the end of the else clause would fix any issues there.

The corrected code should look like this:

if (x > 0) = a; else b = 2;

That way, inside the if condition, a is assigned 1 (implicitly by being set to 1?), and in the else part, b is assigned 2. Wait, but maybe it's better to explicitly write a=1 and b=2 for clarity.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was intended to be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But given that the original used ; at the end of each line, maybe they want it in one line. So combining everything, replacing @ with = and fixing the structure gives the corrected code.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by using `@` instead of an assignment operator (`=`) and incorrect use of comments for code continuation.

```python
if (x > 0) = a; else b = 2;
```

or:

```python
if (x>0): pass
a=1 if x>0 else 2
```

The correct fixed version uses proper assignment operators, removes the # symbols which are used for comments instead of indicating code continuation, and ensures each statement is properly terminated with a semicolon.

The final answer is:

```python
if (x > 0) = a; else b = 2;
```
