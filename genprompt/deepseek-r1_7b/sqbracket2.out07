Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, so the code starts with an if statement. It has brackets around "a=1;" and then an else clause. After that, there's another ] which is causing the error.

I remember that in many programming languages like C or JavaScript, when you have a block inside an if condition, you use curly braces. Here, it looks like they're using square brackets instead of curly braces. So the code might be trying to create an array or something with [a=1;], but that's not valid syntax.

The else clause is followed by another ], which probably closes the if block too early. The correct structure should have only one ] after the if condition, and then the else part without another bracket.

So, I think the mistake is using square brackets around a=1;. Instead of brackets, it should be curly braces {} to define a block inside the if statement.

Also, the extra ] at the end is closing the if block again, which isn't needed. So removing that last ] should fix the error.

Putting it all together: change [a=1; ] to {a=1;} and remove the final ]. That way, the code will have proper syntax without any unexpected brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
