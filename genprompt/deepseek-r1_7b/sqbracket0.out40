Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided some code with a syntax error and an error message saying "syntax error." They want me to fix the code without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond the given information. 

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Hmm, I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or JavaScript, when you have an if-else statement, each condition should be followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces. Here, the code inside the if and else is written with square brackets instead of curly braces.

So, the first issue is using [ ] where it shouldn't be. I need to replace those brackets with curly braces {} because they're not valid syntax for defining code blocks in an if statement.

Next, looking at the structure: after the if condition, there's a semicolon ; which suggests that maybe the code block was incomplete or improperly placed before. The user's code has ] else b=2; ], which might be causing the brackets to close prematurely or incorrectly.

So, I should replace both sets of square brackets with curly braces. Let me restructure it:

- Change [ a = 1; ] to { a = 1; }
- Similarly, change the last ] after else to } so that the code block closes properly.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should have two blocks inside each if and else statement, enclosed in curly braces. This should fix the syntax error because now both conditions are correctly followed by their respective code blocks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
