Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this code snippet based solely on the syntax error provided. The code given is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The user mentioned that the syntax might be different from languages like C, Java, or Python, but they have access to certain symbols. I should use only what's in the error message.

First, looking at the code structure, it seems like an if-else statement. In many programming languages, the else clause is part of the same if block and ends with a semicolon. Here, it looks like after the if condition, there's an opening square bracket [ which might not be correct in this context.

In the code, after 'if (x > 0)', there's a '[', then 'a = 1;]', followed by else and another block. But looking closely, I think the issue is with how the blocks are structured.

The syntax error "syntax error" suggests that the code isn't valid in terms of the language's grammar. One common mistake could be mismatched braces or brackets. Here, it seems like the code inside the if statement ends abruptly after 'a = 1;]', but I don't see a closing brace for the if block.

Another possibility is that the else statement is improperly placed. In some languages, you might need to close the if block properly before using an else. Alternatively, maybe the square brackets are being used incorrectly, perhaps as part of array indexing or something else, which isn't appropriate here.

Wait, another thought: in some programming languages like JavaScript, for example, if-else blocks don't require braces unless you want to define a block. So maybe the code is trying to assign 'a=1' inside the if condition but using brackets incorrectly.

Looking at the structure again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

So between the if and else, there's an assignment in square brackets, which might not be intended. Maybe it should just be 'a=1;' without any extra brackets or syntax around it.

Also, after the closing bracket of the if statement, perhaps another ] is misplaced, causing a syntax error because it's not properly closed.

So putting this together, I think the main issues are:

1. The else clause doesn't have its own proper block structure. So maybe removing the else part or adjusting how it's applied would fix it.
2. The use of square brackets where they're unnecessary could cause confusion for the interpreter/compiler.
3. Possibly a missing closing brace for the if statement, causing the code to end abruptly.

But wait, in many languages like JavaScript, you can write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

So perhaps the original code is trying to do something similar but with incorrect syntax. The square brackets might be used incorrectly, and the code isn't properly closed.

Alternatively, if this code is using a different language where block structures are denoted differently, maybe it's missing braces altogether.

But given that the error message just says "syntax error," I should focus on how to correctly structure an if-else statement without any unnecessary brackets or mismatched symbols.

So perhaps the correct way is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This makes sense because each block under if and else has its own braces. So I removed the extra square brackets and properly enclosed the statements within the if and else blocks using curly braces, which are more likely to be supported in many languages.

Alternatively, depending on how the language handles assignments inside conditionals, maybe just having 'a=1;' without any conditions is not intended, but given the code structure, adding the correct syntax should fix it.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect use of square brackets and improper block closing. To fix the syntax error, we replace the square brackets with curly braces for each conditional block.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
