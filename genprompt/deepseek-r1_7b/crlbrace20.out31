Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix a syntax error in this code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." Let me look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, first, I notice that there's an extra closing curly brace at the end of the if statement. The code starts with `if (x > 0) {`, then inside it has `{ a = 1; }`. Then there's an `else` block starting without a corresponding opening brace. So after `else`, it should have `{ ... }` to enclose the statements.

So, the structure is off. The original code probably intended to have both the if and else blocks properly enclosed within their own braces. Let me try rewriting that part correctly.

The corrected code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }
```

Wait, but in this case, I removed one of the extra closing braces and added the missing else block with its own braces. So the syntax error was because there were two closing braces at the end—maybe a typo where an extra brace got added or another missed.

Yes, that makes sense. The user wanted to fix it using symbols from the error message, like curly braces, which are likely available. So adding the missing else block with braces should resolve the syntax issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }
```
