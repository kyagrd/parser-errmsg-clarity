Thinking...
Alright, so I have to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

First, the code provided is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I know that Python uses colons for defining blocks, and indentation matters. The original code has an if statement followed by an else clause without proper block structure.

Looking at the error message: syntax error. That makes sense because in Python, each conditional statement (like if) must be followed by a colon and then indented lines for the block. 

In the given code, after the if condition, there's only one line inside the braces { }, which is 'a = 1;'. Then, the else clause starts with 'else b = 2;', but it doesn't have any indentation, meaning it's not part of the if block. That's incorrect because in Python, the else should be part of the same level as the if statement.

So, to fix this, I need to make sure that both the if and else statements are properly indented within their own blocks. 

I'll adjust the code so that after the if condition with its block, the else also has a correctly indented block. The corrected code should look like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

This way, both conditions are properly nested within their respective blocks, and the syntax error is resolved.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error, we need to ensure that each conditional block in Python is correctly indented. The original code has improperly aligned blocks for the if statement.

The corrected code with proper indentation is:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

This uses consistent indentation (one tab) for each block, ensuring that both conditions are correctly associated with their respective code blocks.
