Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, so there's a problem with the braces here.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that the if statement starts with an opening brace { and ends it properly. Then comes the else clause which is followed by another }. But wait, the else part might not be correctly structured.

In the code, after the if block, there's only one }, but then the else statement is written as "else b = 2; }", adding another closing brace at the end. That's probably causing an extra brace, which makes the parser confused because it expects only one closing brace for the if statement.

Let me break it down:

- The code starts with if (x >0) { a=1; }, which is correct.
- Then there's } else b =2; }

Wait, no. Actually, the structure should be: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }. So after the if block closes with }, it should check if the else part has its own braces.

So in the given code, the else clause is written as "else b=2;", but without braces. But maybe the problem is that there's an extra closing brace at the end of the line.

Wait, looking again: the code ends with } after else... So perhaps the else statement isn't properly closed or opened. Let me count the braces:

1. The if block has { and }, so two braces for the if part? Wait no, actually it's one opening { and then inside that { a=1; }, then another } to close the if. But wait, in the code given, it's written as:

if (x >0) { a = 1; } else b=2; }

So after the first }, which closes the if block, there's an else statement, and then another } at the end.

But that would make the structure like: if (... ) { ... } else ..., but no braces around the else part. So when it reaches the end of the line, there's an extra } because the code is trying to close something that doesn't exist yet.

Wait, perhaps the error is that after the if block closes with }, then in the same line, the else is written without a new block, so adding another } tries to close nothing. Alternatively, maybe it's better to enclose the else part within braces for clarity and correctness.

So to fix this, I think the code should properly structure the else clause by adding braces around b=2.

Let me rewrite it:

if (x >0) { a =1; } else { b =2; }

This way, each condition has its own block. The initial code only had one closing brace after the if statement, but perhaps the else was outside of that, leading to an extra brace at the end.

So in the fixed code, I added braces around the else part and removed the trailing } because it's not needed anymore.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
