Thinking...
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some JavaScript code. The user provided the error message as "syntax error" and the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, let me look at this line by line. 

First, the if statement: if (x > 0) is correct. Then inside the block, there's an assignment to 'a'. That looks fine.

Next comes the else part: else b = 2;. Wait, in JavaScript, when you have an else clause, it should be followed by a block as well, right? So I think the issue here is that after the else keyword, we need curly braces to enclose any statements. 

Looking at the code again, after 'else' there's just 'b = 2;' without braces. That would cause a syntax error because JavaScript expects an opening brace for the else block.

So to fix it, I should add an opening curly brace right after 'else', and then close it before the semicolon that ends the if statement. Let me visualize this:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but in the original code, there's only one semicolon at the end of the else line, which is correct because each block inside if-else should have its own braces.

So I think adding the curly braces after 'else' will fix the syntax error. Let me check again: The if statement opens with { and then a = 1; }, and the else also opens with { and b=2; }. That makes sense now because each condition has its block properly enclosed.
...done thinking.

The code contains a syntax error because the `else` statement is missing an opening curly brace. To fix this, add `{` after `else`.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
