Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me read through what's provided.

The user has shared some code that's causing an error and the specific error message they're getting. The error is: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a problem with braces in their code.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I see that they have an if-else statement. The code inside is correctly indented for the if part: `a=1;` is within `{}`. Then there's an else clause, but here it's just `b=2;`, and then another closing brace `}`.

Wait a minute, let me break it down. The if condition is `(x > 0)`, then braces for the block inside: `{ a =1; }`. So that's one level of braces closed after the if statement.

Then comes the else clause: `else b=2;` and another brace at the end `}`. But wait, in an if-else structure, you have two possibilities: either the if is followed by its own block, then the else block (which can also be a block), or each on their own lines with braces.

In this code, after the if's closing brace, they're trying to put `else b=2;` but without braces. But in some languages like JavaScript or Python, you can have single-line conditionals without braces, but here it seems like maybe the error is about having an extra brace at the end.

Wait, let me think again. The code as written:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

So after the if's closing }, there's an else clause with `b=2;` and then another }. So that would mean two closing braces: one for the if, one for what? Maybe it's causing the parser to think that the else is outside of any block.

Because in correct syntax, each if-else should have their own blocks. So perhaps the code should be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

That way, both the if and else are within their own braces. In the original code, after closing the if's block with }, there's an else without braces followed by another }, which would close something that doesn't exist yet, leading to the syntax error about unexpected '}'.

So I think the solution is to add curly braces around the else part so that both are properly enclosed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
