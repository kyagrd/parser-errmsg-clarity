Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where the user provided some code with a syntax error and an error message. My task is to fix the code using only the information from the error message, without relying on any pre-trained knowledge. 

First, let me read the code they provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or C++, the ternary operator is used with the syntax ?:. So it's probably something similar here. The user has an if statement but then uses @a = 1;, which doesn't make sense because @ isn't a keyword in many languages for assignment.

Looking at the error message, it just says "syntax error". That means there's a problem with how the code is structured or written. 

I notice that after the if condition, they have @a = 1; followed by # else b = 2; and another # at the end. The # symbols look like they might be starting some kind of comment or maybe a preprocessor directive. In C/C++, the # is used for preprocessing with include files, so perhaps that's part of the issue.

Wait, but in this code, there are # signs which could mean that the lines following them are comments. So maybe the user intended to write a ternary operator instead of separate if-else statements. 

In C/C++, you can write an inline conditional with the ternary operator like (condition) ? expr1 : expr2; So in this case, replacing @a = 1 and # else b=2; with something that uses the ternary operator would fix the issue.

So putting it all together, maybe the original code was meant to be:

if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;

But since they used @ instead of ?, and also included comments which might not be necessary here. So removing those # signs and replacing @ with ? should fix the syntax.

So the corrected code would be: if (x>0) ?a=1 :b=2;. I think that's it because now the ternary operator is correctly used without any extra characters like #, which were causing confusion.
...done thinking.

```
if (x>0) ?a=1 :b=2;
```
