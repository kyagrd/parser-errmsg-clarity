Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. Let me look at it again. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, the error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause". That means there's something wrong with the curly braces here.

Looking closer, I see that after the else statement, it just has 'b=2;' and then a closing brace. Wait, does that mean the code is trying to close the if-else block again? But in reality, the if-else should only have one level of braces.

So the original code probably meant for both cases (x>0 and x<=0) to execute some code. So maybe I need to adjust how the braces are structured.

Let me think: The if statement starts with {, then inside is a=1;, followed by }, but that's closing the if block immediately without considering the else part. But in an if-else structure, both blocks should be enclosed within the same level of braces.

So I need to make sure that after the else, everything up until the next semicolon is included in the else block. That way, the curly braces only close when they're properly matched.

So instead of having just } else ..., I should have else { ... }. Also, there's an extra closing brace at the end which isn't needed because the entire if-else can be enclosed with a single pair.

Putting it all together: The corrected code should have both a and b assignments within their respective blocks. So:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}

That way, each block is properly enclosed with its own curly braces, and there's only one level of braces around the entire if-else statement.

I should also remove any trailing semicolon after the closing brace to avoid syntax issues. So the final code doesn't end with an extra } that doesn't match anything.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because the else clause is not properly closed. The correct way is to enclose both branches within a single block and ensure proper nesting of braces.

```fix
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```

The fixed code now correctly has two separate blocks for the if and else cases, each enclosed in their own set of curly braces. This removes the syntax error related to an unclosed brace.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Enclose the first block (a=1) within its own {}.
2. Add an else { } clause immediately after to handle the alternative case.
3. Enclose both blocks (if and else) in a single outermost {}.
4. Remove any trailing semicolon or unnecessary braces.

Final code:
```fix
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```
