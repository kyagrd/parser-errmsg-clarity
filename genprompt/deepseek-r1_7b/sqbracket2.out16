Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this code based on the given error message. The error is an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which suggests there's a mismatched bracket somewhere. 

Looking at the code provided:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I notice that inside the if statement, there are square brackets used instead of parentheses or some other structure. The first part is `if (x > 0) [`, which might be incorrect because typically an if statement starts with parentheses like `( )`. 

The error message points out an unexpected ']' after the else clause, so I think the issue is that there's a closing bracket where it shouldn't be. Let me break it down:

1. The code has `if (x > 0) [`, which seems off because usually, after `if`, we have parentheses for conditions.
2. Then there's an else statement: `else b = 2; ]`. Here, the closing bracket `]` is at the end of the line.

Putting it together, maybe the square brackets are causing confusion. Perhaps they should be replaced with regular parentheses to match standard syntax. Let me try replacing `[ a = 1; ]` with `(a = 1);` and check:

- The if condition becomes `(x > 0) (a = 1);`, which seems correct.
- Then the else statement is `else b = 2;` without any extra brackets, so I remove the trailing `]`.

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript or others, square brackets might be used for arrays. But here, it's inside an if statement, so using them incorrectly could cause issues.

Alternatively, maybe the code was intended to use braces `{}` for blocks, but that's not standard either. I'm more inclined to think it's a typo with parentheses.

So, replacing `[ a = 1; ]` with `(a = 1);` should fix the issue because now there are no extra brackets causing the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) (a = 1); else b = 2;
```
