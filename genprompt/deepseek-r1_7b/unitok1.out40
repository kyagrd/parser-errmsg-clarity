Thinking...
Alright, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message is "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, okay, let me look at the code to understand what's wrong.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I see that there are some angle brackets here: '《' and '》'. I'm not sure if those are part of the problem. Maybe they're supposed to be something else, like comments or maybe they were meant to represent curly braces? Or perhaps it's a typo.

Looking at the error message, it mentions an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So the issue is probably with how the brackets are being used here. The code starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Inside that block, there's this part: `《 a = 1; 》`, which seems to be closing the if block because of the angle bracket. Then, after the else clause, there's another '》', but that might not be needed.

Wait, in standard Java or JavaScript syntax, curly braces are used for blocks, so maybe those angle brackets shouldn't be there at all. So perhaps the code was supposed to use curly braces instead of '《' and '》'. That would make sense because the else clause is part of the same if statement.

So replacing '《' with '{' and '》' with '}' should fix it. Let me try that:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes, that looks better. The angle brackets were causing the parser to think there's an unexpected character after the else clause because it wasn't part of any block closing properly.

I should also check if there are any missing braces or commas. In this case, the code seems straightforward once I replace those symbols with curly braces.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by using angle brackets instead of curly braces to define code blocks. The corrected code replaces '《' and '》' with '{' and '}' respectively.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
