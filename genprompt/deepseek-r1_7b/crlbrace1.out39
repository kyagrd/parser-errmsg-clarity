Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where the user has provided some code that's causing a syntax error. The error message is "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here.

So, the code given is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
I can see that there are curly braces {} in the if statement. The if condition checks if x is greater than 0 and then executes a=1;. Then there's an else clause with another assignment to b=2;, but I notice something at the end—the code ends with another } after the else block.

Wait, let me count the braces properly. The first part is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`, which has opening and closing braces correctly. Then there's an `else` statement followed by `b=2; }`. Oh, I see now—after the else clause, they have another curly brace at the end of the line.

So, in programming languages like Java or JavaScript, each if-else structure must be properly closed with matching braces. In this case, after the else, there's an extra closing brace which is causing a syntax error because it doesn't match any opening brace for that statement.

Looking back at the code, the structure should probably be:
if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

So in this case, maybe they intended to have both cases within their own blocks. Let me check: The original code has `a=1;` inside the if block and then after the else clause, it's just an assignment without a block. Wait no, actually, looking again:

The user wrote:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So here, the first if has its body correctly closed with }. Then, the else is followed by 'b=2;' and then another }, which doesn't match anything because after else, you typically have an indented block. But in this code, it's not indented—so maybe that's causing confusion.

Wait, perhaps what they meant was to have both a and b assigned within their own if-else blocks. So the corrected code should probably be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But looking at the original code, after 'else' there's only 'b=2;' without an opening brace. But then they have another } which is causing the error because it's not properly closed.

Wait no, in the user's code, after the else, it's just 'b=2;}'—so that might mean that the assignment is outside any if-else block, hence a syntax error because of the extra brace. So to fix this, I need to correctly close the else clause with its own braces.

Alternatively, perhaps they intended for both cases (x>0 and x<=0) to have their own assignments within an if-else structure.

So putting it all together, the correct code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But let's see: The original code has after 'else' just 'b=2;', and then another }, which is not matching any opening brace. So adding an opening brace after the else should fix this.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each statement inside if or else has its own block with braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
