Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I see that there's an if statement followed by an else, but I don't think they're properly indented. Wait, no, looking closer, it's written as one line after another without any new lines. So maybe the code is trying to use both if and else in a way that isn't valid.

The error message mentions a '#' after else, so perhaps there's an attempt to add comments or something after the else clause. Let me check each part.

First, "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;". This seems like a line with an if condition and some code inside it using the @ operator. Then, right after that, there's "# else b = 2;" which is probably trying to add an else statement but in the wrong place.

Wait, maybe this code was intended to have an else block after the if statement, but it's written incorrectly. So perhaps I should adjust how these statements are structured.

Looking at the error message again: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". The '#' is likely a comment or part of a multi-line string that's causing confusion. Maybe the code was supposed to have an if-else structure but isn't properly formatted.

So, I think the correct approach is to separate these into two separate statements with proper indentation and without any syntax errors. So instead of having everything on one line, maybe we should write them as separate lines or within a block that's correctly indented.

Let me try rewriting it. Instead of writing both conditions in a single line after if and else, I can structure each statement properly.

So the original code was:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I think what they intended was to have an if-else block with proper indentation. So adjusting that, it would be something like:

if (x > 0) {
    @a = 1;
} else {
    @b = 2;
}

This way, each condition is properly indented and the code runs without syntax errors. Also, removing the comments since they were causing issues with the structure.

So that's how I can fix it based on the error message.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    @a = 1;
} else {
    @b = 2;
}
```
