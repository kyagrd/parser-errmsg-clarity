Thinking...
Alright, let's figure out how to fix this syntax error. The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So I need to understand what part of the code is causing this.

Looking at the code, it starts with an if condition: `if (x > 0)`. Then there's `[ a = 1; ]` which seems like an array assignment inside the braces. After that, there's an else clause without any opening brace and then another closing brace, ending with `]`.

Wait, the code is written as:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I see that after the if statement's condition, they have `[ a = 1; ]`. That might be inside an array or part of another structure. But then, the else is following immediately without any braces.

In JavaScript, each block needs to be enclosed in curly braces `{}` for compound statements. The user probably tried to assign `a` and `b` but forgot the braces around them.

So the error occurs because there's an extra closing bracket `]` after the else clause, which isn't needed if it's a single statement without any additional blocks.

I think the fix is to remove that last `]`. So instead of having `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`, removing the final `]` will correct the syntax because each statement block should be properly closed with `{}` or just as a single line if no braces are needed.

Let me check: after removing, it becomes:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]
else b = 2;
```
That looks better. The else is now correctly placed without any extra brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
