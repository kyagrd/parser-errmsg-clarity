Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an example with some messed-up code and wants me to fix it based only on the error message they mentioned, which is "syntax error." 

The original code looks like this:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm. I remember that syntax errors usually mean something's wrong with how the code is structured or the use of certain symbols. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the if statement: "if (x > 0)". That seems fine on its own. Then there are these funny-looking characters: 《 and 》. I'm not sure what those are in programming contexts. Maybe they're supposed to be brackets or something else entirely?

In many languages like C or Java, you have curly braces {} for blocks of code, but here it's using 《 and 》 instead. So maybe the user intended to use curly braces after all. Let me check that.

Looking at the code inside: "a = 1;". That's correct if we're inside an if block. But then there's another line: "else b = 2;" which is correct for else, but where are its braces? If I have the structure wrong, maybe that's causing a syntax issue.

Wait, in some languages like JavaScript or Python, indentation matters. So perhaps the code after the else isn't properly indented, leading to a syntax error.

Putting it all together: The if statement starts with 《 and ends with 》, but then the else is outside of any block. Also, maybe the extra closing brace at the end (the second 》) is causing an issue because there's no matching opening brace for that last one.

So to fix this, I should probably replace those 《 and 》 with standard curly braces {}. Let me try rewriting it:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes more sense. The if block has its own braces, and the else is properly closed. That should fix the syntax error because all the blocks are correctly enclosed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
