Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)." Let me look at the code they provided.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I remember that in programming, especially in languages like Java or C++, we use curly braces `{}` to enclose statements inside an if statement. The user's error message mentions '》', which looks like the closing of a curly brace but might be using a different character.

Looking at the code, after the else clause, there's another 》. That seems off because once the outer if-else block is closed with its own }, any additional } would cause an error. 

Also, I notice that instead of using { and }, they used 《 and 》. These might be unicode characters for curly braces, but in most coding environments, we use the standard ones.

So, the code should replace both 《 and 》 with { and }. Also, since the outer if-else is already closed at the end of else, having an extra } would cause a syntax error.

Let me rewrite the code correctly. The if statement opens with (x > 0) {, then inside it has a =1;. Then the else part should be else b=2; and close the outer block with }. 

Putting it all together, the fixed code should have braces instead of 《 and 》 at both places.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```
