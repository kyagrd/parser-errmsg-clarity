Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet here and an error message pointing out a syntax issue. Let me try to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause". Hmm, I remember that in some programming languages, when you have an if statement, you need to make sure each part is correctly closed. 

Wait, here's what's happening: the code starts with an if condition, then uses the `@` symbol followed by `a = 1;`. After that, it tries to write an else clause but ends up using a `#`, which I think is a comment in many languages. But the error mentions something after the else clause, so maybe there's another issue.

In some languages like C or Java, if you have multiple statements inside the if block, they need to be properly indented and closed with semicolons. Maybe this code is similar. So the `@ a = 1;` part might not be correct syntax on its own because it lacks an else clause after the if condition.

I also notice that there are two `#` symbols at the end, which in C-like languages denote comments. It seems like those were meant to separate the statements but ended up being part of the code instead.

So perhaps the issue is that the code isn't properly structured within the if statement. The original line after the if block has an else clause but it's not correctly placed or closed, leading to the error about unexpected `#`.

To fix this, I think we need to restructure the code so that each part of the if-else statement is on a new line with proper indentation and comments removed from the end.

So, instead of having all those parts mixed together, we should separate them into lines. The if condition should be followed by its block, then an else block. Each block should have correct syntax without any trailing comments.

Putting it all together, each statement inside the if and else blocks should be on their own line with proper indentation. That way, the code is syntactically correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    @ a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
