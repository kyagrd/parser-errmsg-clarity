Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's supposed to have a syntax error. The user provided the code and an error message saying there's a syntax issue. My task is to fix it using only the information from the error message and without any prior knowledge beyond what's given here.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I notice that after the if statement, there's an @ symbol. In programming, especially in languages like C or Python, the @ symbol is used for decorators in Python or as part of certain operators. But here, it doesn't seem to fit within an if statement.

The code has two statements: one inside the if block and another outside with else. The first line after the if starts with @ a = 1; which looks like some kind of assignment operator. In C-like syntax, maybe using @ isn't valid here. But in Python, decorators are placed before function calls, so I'm not sure that's applicable.

Also, looking at the structure: there's an if block followed by else without any braces or brackets, but since it's written as separate lines with semicolons, perhaps the problem is that multiple statements on one line aren't allowed. Or maybe the @ symbol isn't a valid operator in this context.

Wait, another thought: In C++, you can have multiple statements inside braces, but here there are two separate if-else blocks without braces. But I think in Python or other languages, each conditional block is indented and followed by code with colons and indents. So maybe the problem is that using @ isn't correct here.

But considering the error message just says "syntax error," perhaps it's about improper use of operators. Maybe using @ in this way isn't allowed after an if statement without being part of a decorator or function call, which isn't present here.

So I think the fix is to remove the @ symbol because it's not appropriate in this context. The intended code was probably something like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But since there are no braces, maybe just removing the @ and keeping the if-else structure as is.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense. The @ was an error because it's not needed here.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to the incorrect use of the `@` symbol within an if statement. The `@` operator is not applicable in this context and should be removed.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
