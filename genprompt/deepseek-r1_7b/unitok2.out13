Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem again. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Hmm, so somewhere in the code, a character isn't recognized properly.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice that after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there are these symbols: 《 and 》. It seems like they're being used as some kind of delimiters or comments.

Wait, in many programming languages, there are specific comment syntaxes. For example, in C, we use `/* */`, but here it looks like the user is using 《 and 》 which might be intended as a custom comment style.

So, maybe those symbols should be part of a multi-line comment or some kind of block structure instead of being standalone characters. But looking at how they're placed in the code:

The code starts with if (x > 0) followed by 《a = 1;》 else b=2; 》

So after the if's closing bracket, there are two comments: one for a and another after else.

Wait, no. The structure is:
if (...) 《 a=1; 》 else ... 》

This might be trying to create block-level comments that span multiple lines, but it's incorrectly placed here because they're inside the if statement's scope but not properly ending before the else.

Alternatively, maybe these symbols are being used as delimiters for some conditional formatting or code blocks. But in standard syntax, those characters aren't recognized unless part of a specific language feature.

Wait, perhaps 《 and 》 are not valid operators here. So when the code is parsed, after the if statement's closing parenthesis, it sees '》' which isn't expected because the else clause starts immediately.

So to fix this, I should remove those symbols so that the else clause comes right after the if block without any extra characters causing a syntax error.

Therefore, I'll delete 《 and 》 from both places. The corrected code would be:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That way, there are no unexpected symbols between the if statement's closing bracket and the else clause, so the syntax error should be resolved.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
