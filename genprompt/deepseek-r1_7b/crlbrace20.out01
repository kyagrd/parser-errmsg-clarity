Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix a syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

The code provided is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
And the error message is "syntax error."

First, I'll check the structure of an if-else statement in most programming languages. Typically, it should be written as:

if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

Looking at the given code, after the first block ends with `}`, there's another `}` which is causing a syntax error because each if statement should have its own braces.

Wait, no, actually, in some languages like JavaScript or C, you don't need separate braces for each condition. But here, the code seems to end with two closing braces, which might not be correct depending on the language. However, more likely, the structure is incorrect because the else block isn't properly enclosed.

In the given code, after `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`, there's an `else b = 2;` statement followed by another closing brace. That might not be correct syntax because the else should be indented and within its own braces if needed.

So, I think the problem is that the else block isn't properly enclosed. The code should have the else part inside curly braces as well. Alternatively, maybe the code uses a different style where each statement ends with a semicolon without braces, but in that case, using braces would fix it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of the if-else is incorrect because after the first `}`, there's another `}` which isn't necessary or correctly placed.

Wait, let me think again. In most languages, an if statement can end with a single brace covering both branches if needed, but here, the code has two separate blocks without proper nesting.

Alternatively, maybe the code is using a syntax where else doesn't need braces and should be on the same line as the if's closing brace, but that's not standard. More likely, in the given code, after the first `if` block ends with `}`, then there's an `else`, which isn't inside any braces, leading to the syntax error.

So, to fix it, I can either:

1. Properly indent and close each else block if necessary.
2. Ensure that each statement is correctly placed without extra braces.

But since the code uses `{ }` around assignments, perhaps each condition should be enclosed in its own braces. So, adjusting the structure to have the else inside a brace would fix it.

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript, you can write:

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else {
    b=2;
}

So, in this case, the first block is within braces, and the else is also within its own braces. Alternatively, if the code doesn't use braces for each statement but just semicolons, then maybe the structure needs to be adjusted.

Looking at the original code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

The problem here is that after the first block ends with `}`, there's an `else` followed by `b=2; }`. This seems like an extra closing brace, which might be causing the syntax error.

So, to fix it, I can adjust the structure so that each if-else clause is properly enclosed within braces. So, rewrite it as:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, both the true and false blocks are properly enclosed in their own braces, which should resolve the syntax error.

Alternatively, if the code doesn't use braces for each statement but relies on semicolons, perhaps the issue is that the else isn't properly attached. But given the presence of braces around `a=1`, it's more likely a matter of adding braces to enclose the else part as well.

So, the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but that might still not be correct because in some languages, you can have else without braces if it's on the same line. However, considering the original code uses `{}`, adding them consistently would make sense.

But actually, looking again, perhaps the error is due to having two closing braces: one after the a=1 and another at the end of the else statement, making three braces in total which might not be intended.

Wait, let me count:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So, it's:

Line 1: if (...){ a=1; }
Line 2: } else b=2;
Line 3: }

That's three closing braces. Wait no, the first line ends with `}`, then on line two, there's `else b=2;` followed by another `}`. So that makes the structure:

Line 1: if (...) { a=1; }
Line 2: } else ...
Wait, actually, the code is written as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

}

Which implies that after the first block's }, there's an else which isn't indented and then another }. So it's more like:

if (...) {
    a = 1;
} else
b = 2; }

Wait, no. The code as written is:

if (x >0) {a=1;}
else b=2;

}

So the first block ends with }, then else is at the same indentation level but not indented? No, in most languages, after a closing brace of an if statement, you can't have another statement unless it's on the same line or properly indented.

Wait, perhaps the code is written as:

if (x>0) {a=1; } else b=2;

}

Which might mean that after the first block ends with }, then 'else' is at the same level but not inside any braces. That would be invalid because you can't have a statement outside of an if-else block unless it's part of another structure.

But in this case, perhaps the code is trying to write:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else
b=2;

}

Which ends with two closing braces. Wait, that would be incorrect because after the first }, then 'else' followed by b=2; and another }.

Wait, maybe the correct structure should have only one closing brace at the end of the entire if-else statement. So perhaps it's intended to write:

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else {
    b=2;
}

But in this case, without braces for each block, you can't have else with a separate statement unless they're on the same line.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be written as:

if (x > 0)
{
    a = 1;
}
else
{
    b = 2;
}

Which is valid and has proper braces. So in this case, the original code had two closing braces after the else statement, which caused the syntax error.

Therefore, the correct approach is to add braces around each block.

Wait, but perhaps the user intended that the else part doesn't need a brace if it's just one statement, so maybe:

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else b=2;

But without braces for the else block. However, in many languages, you can write:

if (...) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}

Or alternatively, as separate statements on the same line.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because different programming styles vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect because after the first }, it's trying to have another statement outside of any block, which isn't allowed unless it's part of a different structure.

In that case, the correct way is to properly enclose each else clause within braces. So:

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else {
    b=2;
}

But in this code, there are two closing braces: one after a=1 and another at the end. So perhaps the problem is that it's using three braces instead of two.

Wait no, let me see:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So line breaks are as follows:

Line 1: if (...){ a=1; }
Line 2: } else
Line 3: b=2;
Line 4: }

Wait, but that would mean that after the first }, it's trying to have an else statement at the same indentation level, which is invalid. So perhaps the fix is to properly indent and close each block.

So rewriting as:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

This way, both blocks are within their own braces, avoiding any syntax errors.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to improper placement of braces. The `else` statement is not enclosed in its own block after the initial assignment, leading to an invalid structure. By properly enclosing each part within braces, we fix the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
