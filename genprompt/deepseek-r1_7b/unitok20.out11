Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code with a syntax error and I need to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond the given error message. Let me look at the problem step by step.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

And the error message says there's a syntax error. Hmm, I remember that in many programming languages, parentheses and brackets need to be properly closed. Let me check each part.

First, looking at the if statement: `if (x > 0)`. That seems fine because it has an opening parenthesis after 'if' and a closing one after the condition.

Next, there's this part inside the if block: `《 a = 1; 》`. I'm not sure what those symbols are. The error message doesn't specify the type of error, but since it's a syntax error, maybe it's about incorrect brackets or braces. Maybe the angle brackets (《 and 》) are causing an issue.

Then there's the else block: `else b = 2;`. That also seems fine because 'else' is properly followed by a space and then the statement.

Wait, so putting it all together, the code structure might be like this:
if (x > 0) { ... } else { ... }

But in the original code, after the if condition, there's an angle bracket instead of a curly brace for the opening block. Then after the else statement, another angle bracket is used without matching.

So the issue is that the programmer probably intended to use curly braces `{}` but mistakenly used 《 and 》 which are not recognized by most languages. So replacing those with regular curly braces should fix it.

Let me try rewriting the code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That looks better because each block is properly enclosed within curly braces, and the else statement correctly follows the if. The semicolons are also in the right place.

I think this should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
