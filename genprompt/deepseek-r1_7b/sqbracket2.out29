Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me break down the problem and figure out what's wrong with the code.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I notice that there are two closing brackets here. The first part is `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`, which seems to be an if statement with some code inside. Then there's an else clause: `else b = 2; ]`. Wait, the else is followed by another closing bracket, but it shouldn't be there because the initial if statement already has its own brackets.

So, I think the issue is that there are too many closing brackets. The first part correctly uses `[ a = 1; ]` for some reason, maybe it's a typo or an incorrect syntax. Then, after the else, another `]` closes the code, which isn't needed because the outer if-else statement should already be closed.

Let me count the opening and closing brackets:

The code starts with `[`, then inside that, there's `a = 1; ]`. So that's an extra bracket. Then after else, there's another `]`. But actually, the outer structure is just one if-else without any deeper nesting.

So, I should remove the extra opening and closing brackets to fix this syntax error. The correct code shouldn't have `[` or `]` around the inner statement unless it's a specific feature of that language, but since the user mentioned it might be different from languages like C, Java, Python, etc., perhaps this is just part of their code structure.

Wait, maybe the brackets were meant to denote an array or something else. But in this context, without proper syntax, they're causing an error. So, removing them should fix the issue.

So, I'll remove the `[` at the beginning and the `]` after else, keeping only one level of closing bracket.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
