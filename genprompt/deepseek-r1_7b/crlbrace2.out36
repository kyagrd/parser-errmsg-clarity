Thinking...
Alright, let's take a look at this code problem. The user provided some code and an error message. The task is to fix the syntax error without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's in the error message. So, first, I'll read the error message carefully: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". This suggests there's a missing or misplaced brace somewhere.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, it seems like the user might be working in a language where braces are used for blocks. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I notice that after the `if` statement's closing brace `{}`, there's an `else` clause on the same line: `} else b = 2;`. Wait, no, actually, let me check again. The code is written as:

- if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So after the first if block ends with `{}`, then it's followed by an `else` statement without any braces. Then there's another semicolon and another brace at the end.

But in many languages, like C or Java, each control structure (if, else) is enclosed within its own braces. So maybe this code isn't using proper block syntax. Let me visualize how it should be structured.

In a language that uses braces for blocks, an if statement would typically look like:

```
if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
   // code
}
```

So in the given code, after the `if` condition's closing brace `{`, there's an `else` clause without any opening brace. That might be causing the error because the compiler expects a block for the else part.

Wait, looking again: The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first if's closing }, there's `else b=2;` immediately following. That might not be correct because in many languages, each block needs to have its own braces.

But perhaps in this case, the code is supposed to be in a context where statements can be on the same line without needing braces. But that seems unlikely. More probably, the else statement should start with an opening brace after else.

Wait, no. If it's written as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

Then this would make sense if there's only one else clause without any block, but that might not be correct because in languages like C or Java, you need braces for multi-statement blocks.

But considering the error message is about an unexpected '}' after else, maybe the code has a syntax issue where an extra brace is present. Let me check again:

The original code ends with `}` which seems to close both if and else clauses incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the else is attached to the if without braces, but then there's another closing brace at the end that doesn't match. Maybe it's trying to have an else block, so we need to add opening and closing braces around the else clause.

So let me reconstruct:

The correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each condition has its own block. So in this case, I added an opening brace after else to start the else block and a closing brace before the semicolon.

Looking back at the original code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

The problem is that after `else`, it's trying to assign `b=2` without an opening brace, but then there's another `}` which doesn't have a matching block. So adding braces around the else part would fix it.

So the fixed code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each if-else clause is properly enclosed within its own braces.
...done thinking.

The code has mismatched braces. The `else` statement was not enclosed in an opening brace and the final closing brace is misplaced.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
