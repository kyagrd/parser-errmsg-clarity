Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code that needs fixing. The user mentioned a syntax error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)." Hmm, so there's an extra closing brace somewhere causing the issue.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Let me break it down. The if statement starts with 'if (x>0)' and has curly braces for its body: '{ a=1; }'. Then, there's an else clause followed by 'b=2;' and another closing brace at the end.

Wait, so after the else clause, we have two closing braces? That can't be right. The first if block is closed with one '}', then the else part should have its own body which might need curly braces or just a single statement without them. But looking at the code, the else is followed by another '}' before the final ';'.

So I think the problem is that there are two closing braces after the else and if statements. The correct structure should only have one closing brace for each block.

Let me rewrite it properly. The if condition has its body within '{ ... }'. Then, the else statement should either be without a body or with one. Since in this case, 'b=2' is just an assignment, maybe it doesn't need braces around it. So I'll adjust the code to remove the extra closing brace.

So the corrected code should have only one closing brace for each if and else part. Let me structure that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
