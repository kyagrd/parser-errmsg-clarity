Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided a piece of code with a syntax error and an error message asking to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond the given message. 

First, I look at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The error is a syntax error. My initial thought is that this is likely an issue with comments in the code. In many programming languages like C or C++, comments start with `//` for single-line and `/* ... */` for block comments. 

Looking at the code, there are two lines using `@` which isn't valid syntax on its own. Then they have `# else`, which seems out of place. I realize that in C, `#` is used for preprocessor directives, not as a comment marker. So perhaps these lines are meant to be comments.

In C, single-line comments start with `/*`, but sometimes people use `@` followed by text and then another `@` or something else. Alternatively, the user might have intended to write two separate comments after the if statement.

So I think the code was supposed to have two comment lines: one for when x > 0 and another for the else case. The current structure is causing a syntax error because it's trying to mix code with comments incorrectly.

To fix this, I'll replace the `@` and `#` parts with proper C-style comments using `//`. Alternatively, since they're on separate lines, converting them into block comments might be more appropriate. 

So the corrected code should have:

- `if (x > 0) { /* a = 1; */ } else { /* b = 2; */ }`

This way, each condition has its own comment block without syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { /* a = 1; */ } else { /* b = 2; */}
```
