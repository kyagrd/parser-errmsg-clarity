Thinking...
Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. Let me look at what's given. The user provided an error message: "syntax error" and the code snippet:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, okay, so first, I should analyze the code to see where the issue is. The code seems to be in some sort of programming language, maybe JavaScript or similar because of the semicolons.

Looking at the structure: it starts with an if statement. The condition is (x > 0), which makes sense. Then there's [ a = 1; ], but wait, that's inside square brackets. I'm not sure why they're there. Also, after the else clause, there's b = 2; ]—notice the extra closing bracket at the end.

So, first thought: maybe the brackets are causing issues. In JavaScript, for example, if you have an array or object, you use square brackets. But here, in the if statement, using [ and ] might not be correct unless it's part of a specific structure, like an array literal within the condition or something else.

Wait, but looking at the code again: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". Oh, I see. The if statement is followed by a block inside square brackets, which might not be necessary unless it's an array. But more importantly, after the else clause, there's another closing bracket and semicolon before the final semicolon.

Wait, no, actually, looking at the code as written: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". So after the else statement, which is followed by b=2; ], there's an extra closing bracket. That might be causing the syntax error because it's not needed.

Let me think step by step:

1. The code starts with if (x > 0), which is correct.
2. Then [ a = 1; ]—this part seems odd. In JavaScript, you don't usually put statements inside square brackets in an if condition like that. Maybe it's trying to create an array but not properly structured.
3. The else statement follows: else b = 2; —that's correct on its own line with the semicolon.
4. Then there's another ] at the end, which doesn't have a corresponding [ before it.

So, I think the main issues are:

- The square brackets around "a=1;" might not be necessary unless they're part of an array or some specific structure that isn't intended here.
- There's an extra closing bracket at the end after the else statement, which is causing the syntax error because it's not balanced.

So to fix this, I should remove the unnecessary square brackets. The code inside the if and else doesn't need them unless it's part of a specific construct like an array or function call that uses those brackets. Since there's no such context here, they can be safely removed.

Additionally, the extra closing bracket at the end is causing the syntax error because JavaScript expects each block to be properly closed. So removing that last ] should resolve the issue.

Let me put this together:

Original code:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Fixed code:
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Wait, but in the original, it's inside square brackets. If I remove them, then 'a=1' and 'b=2' are just statements without any context. But since they're after if-else, that should be fine as standalone statements.

Alternatively, if the intention was to have an array or something else within the condition, but given the error is a syntax error, it's more likely that removing the brackets fixes it.

So yes, the fixed code would remove the [ and ] around 'a=1' and also the extra ] at the end. So the corrected code becomes:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has an unnecessary block of statements inside square brackets after the `if` condition, which is incorrect syntax. Additionally, there's an extra closing bracket at the end that causes the syntax error.

To fix this:
- Remove the enclosing square brackets around the statement in the `if` condition since they're not needed.
- Remove the trailing square bracket to prevent a missing block error.

The corrected code:

```javascript
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
