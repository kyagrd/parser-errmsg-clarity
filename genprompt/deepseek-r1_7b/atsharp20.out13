Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this code that has a syntax error. The code given is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The error message says there's a syntax error. Hmm, let me look at the code carefully.

First, I notice that there are two comment markers at the end: # else b = 2; #. That might not be intentional and could cause issues because comments shouldn't come after the statements in an if-else structure like this.

Then, looking at the line with @ a = 1;, I'm trying to remember what operators are valid in similar contexts. In some languages, there's an assignment operator, but more commonly, people use = for assignment and maybe && or || for logical operations.

Wait, the code seems to mix up control flow keywords like if with assignment operators. Maybe it was intended to be an if statement followed by else, using logical operators instead of comment symbols.

So perhaps replacing @ with && and removing the comments would make sense. Let me try that:

if (x > 0) && a = 1; else b = 2;

That way, when x is greater than 0, it assigns a to 1, otherwise, it assigns b to 2 without needing comments. This should fix the syntax error because it's properly using logical operators and assignment.
...done thinking.

The code has an invalid operator `@` which isn't recognized in typical programming languages. Additionally, there are comment markers that shouldn't be present after the statements.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace `@` with a logical AND (`&&`) to combine conditions.
2. Remove the comment markers as they are not needed.
3. Ensure proper spacing between operators for readability and correctness.

Fixed code:

if (x > 0) && a = 1; else b = 2;

```
if (x > 0) && a = 1; else b = 2;
```
