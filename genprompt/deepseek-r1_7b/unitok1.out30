Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which is part of an if statement already closed. Hmm, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I can see that around line 5 and 6, there are these brackets: 《 and 》. I'm not familiar with these characters, but they're probably causing the issue because the code expects regular parentheses or some other type of brackets.

The error message mentions an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So perhaps those 《 and 》 are being treated as if they were closing brackets for the if statement, which is already closed. But in reality, they shouldn't be there at all.

Looking closer, between the condition (x > 0) and the first semicolon a=1;, there's a tab or some space, but that might not be an issue. The main problem seems to be those extra brackets.

So maybe removing the 《 and 》 would fix it because they're causing syntax errors by appearing after the else clause. Let me try replacing them with parentheses instead? Wait, no, in the code structure, we only have one if statement with an else inside. So the correct syntax should just be standard if-else without those brackets.

So I think the solution is to remove both 《 and 》 from the code.
...done thinking.

The error arises because the unusual brackets 《 and 》 are incorrectly used in place of parentheses. Removing them resolves the syntax issue.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
