Thinking...
Alright, let's figure out how to fix this syntax error. The user provided some code that's causing an issue with unexpected ']' after an else clause. Let me take a look at the code they have:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, okay, so I see there are some brackets here. In the if statement, they've written `(x > 0)[ a = 1; ]`. That looks off because in an if-else condition, we usually don't have square brackets around the block of code after the if. So that's probably where the error is coming from.

Then there's the else clause right after it: `] else b = 2; ]`. I notice they've closed two sets of brackets here. But in reality, each if-else statement should only have one closing bracket at the end. So the extra one before `b=2` is causing another issue.

Let me break this down. The correct structure for an if-else statement in JavaScript (assuming that's what they're using) should be:

if (condition) { ... }
else { ... }

So instead of square brackets, we use curly braces {} to denote the code blocks inside each clause. 

Looking back at their code, I see they used [ and ] around `a = 1;` which isn't valid syntax here. Those should be replaced with curly braces.

Also, after the else statement, there's an extra ]. Let me count: in the if block, there was a ], then else, another [. But that can't be right. Actually, each clause ends with one set of brackets or braces, depending on how it's written.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused because they're mixing square brackets and curly braces. In JavaScript, you use curly braces for the code blocks inside if, else, etc., not square brackets. So that's definitely a mistake here.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should remove the square brackets around `a = 1;` and add curly braces around each block of code. Also, there was an extra closing bracket after else which needs to be removed.

Let me try rewriting this step by step:

Original problematic line:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

First, change the square brackets in if clause to curly braces:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

Then handle the else part. Since it was written as `] else b=2; ]`, we need to add curly braces and remove the extra bracket.

So after else, we should have another block with curly braces:

else { b = 2; }

Putting it all together without any trailing brackets, so the final code becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but in JavaScript, sometimes people omit the curly braces and just write single statements. But since they're assigning values to variables with semicolons, it's safer to use blocks, especially if there were more lines. So including the curly braces is better.

So that should fix the syntax errors by replacing square brackets with curly braces and ensuring each block is properly closed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
