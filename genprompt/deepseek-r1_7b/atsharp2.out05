Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause, which means it's closing a comment too early. 

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I notice that the line ends with `#` right after `else`, which is causing the error because the comment hasn't completed properly.

The problem here is that the comment starts with `#` but doesn't have enough characters before it, so the compiler thinks it's closing something else. In this case, it's probably trying to close the if statement or another part of the code.

I remember that in some programming languages like C, you can use a single-line comment without spaces after the `#`. So instead of having a space between `else` and `#`, I should remove the space so that it reads `else#` which correctly starts the comment as part of the else statement's continuation.

So the corrected code would have no space between `else` and `#`, making it:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in this case, using `else #` might not be correct if I want to include both conditions. Alternatively, maybe the code was meant to have an if-else structure with comments.

But considering the error, it's just about the placement of `#`. So removing the space between else and `#` should fix the syntax issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
