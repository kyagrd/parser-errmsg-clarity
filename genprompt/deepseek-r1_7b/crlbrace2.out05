Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The user provided an error message and the code. Let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

And the error message says: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Hmm, so there's an extra closing brace that doesn't match. Let me look at the code structure.

The if statement starts with `if (x > 0) {` which is good. Then inside the curly braces, there's `a = 1;`. That seems fine because it's indented and part of the if block.

After that, there's an else clause: `else b = 2; }`. Wait, so after the else statement, another closing brace? That doesn't make sense. Because each if-else should be within its own curly braces. If the else is inside another block, it would have its own braces, but here it seems like there's an extra '}' at the end.

Let me count the braces. The code has:
1. One opening brace `{` after `if`.
2. Then inside that, some code.
3. Then `else`, followed by `b = 2;`, and then another closing brace `}`.

But wait, in an if-else statement, both clauses (if and else) should be within their own braces. So maybe the else is intended to have its own block, but it's missing the opening brace before it?

Looking at the code again: after the first if block, there's an else followed by `b=2;` and then a closing brace. That would mean that the else statement doesn't have any block, which is invalid in most languages because you can't just have an else without an if body.

So perhaps the correct structure should be:
- If condition: { a = 1; }
- Else condition: { b = 2; }

But in this code, after the first brace, it's `else b=2; }`, which is outside any block. That's why there's an unexpected '}' because it's trying to close the if statement again.

Wait, no. The initial if has one brace pair, so that's two braces: opening and closing. Then, after the else, another brace is added, making three? But in reality, each if-else should have their own blocks. So perhaps the code was meant to have an else clause with its own block.

So maybe the code should be rewritten as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, both clauses are within their own curly braces, and there's no extra closing brace after the else statement. That would fix the error because the if-else structure is properly closed with one opening and one closing brace.

So in the original code, after `a=1;`, it closes with }, then `else` starts, followed by `b=2;`, but without an opening brace before else? Wait no, that's not correct. The `else` should be inside a block if there is one, or outside. If it's outside, then the code after else doesn't have any block.

Wait, perhaps the original code had only one brace for the entire if statement, which was incorrect because else needs to be within its own block or without a body.

Alternatively, maybe the initial code intended to have both clauses inside separate blocks but forgot the opening brace before else. So that would explain why there's an unexpected closing brace after else because it's not properly enclosed.

So putting it all together, I think the correct approach is to add an opening brace before else and close its block with }, then add another } at the end for the outer if statement.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
