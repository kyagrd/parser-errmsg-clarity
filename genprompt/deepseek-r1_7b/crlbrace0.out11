Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code first. The user provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I notice that there's an extra closing brace here. The structure is if...{ ... } else {...}; But wait, after the else statement, there's another closing brace which doesn't seem right.

In the original code, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So, breaking it down: The if block ends with }, then comes else b=2; and then another }. That means after the else statement, there should be an opening brace for its body. But in the code, instead of that, they have just a semicolon and another closing brace.

That's probably causing the syntax error because the braces aren't matching up correctly. The if block has one }, but the else is followed by another }, which doesn't belong to it.

So, what I should do is remove the extra closing brace at the end of the code. Let me see:

The corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Now, let's check: The if block has one opening and one closing brace. Then, the else statement is followed by its own body without an extra brace because it was mistakenly added.

Yes, that makes sense. So removing the last } should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to an unmatched closing brace. The `else` block's opening brace isn't properly closed. By removing the extra closing brace after the `else`, the syntax becomes correct.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
