Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The error message is "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code provided.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

First, I notice that there are some special characters here: '《' and '》'. These seem to be styled brackets. In standard HTML or CSS, they might represent comments or annotations, but in this context, they're likely being used as a way to add notes between code lines.

Looking at the error message, it says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. The if statement is already closed before that because I see 'if (x > 0) 《 ... 》', which probably closes the if block correctly with those styled brackets.

So the issue must be with the placement of these styled brackets. In the code, after the else clause, there's another '》' at the end. That seems off because it's outside the if statement's scope.

Let me break down the structure:

1. The first part is an if condition: `if (x > 0)`. It has opening and closing styled brackets `《` and `》`, so that correctly wraps the if block.
2. Then, there's an else clause after it: `else b = 2;`. But wait, in standard code, else should be part of the if statement. So maybe this is intended to have an else inside the same if block.

So perhaps the original intention was to write something like:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
But in the code, they're using styled brackets instead of proper curly braces `{}`. So maybe that's why it's causing confusion.

Looking at the error again: there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. That suggests that the parser thought there was a closing bracket when there wasn't one expected. But wait, in the code, the if block is correctly closed with `》` before the else.

Wait no, actually, looking closer:

The code has:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

So after the if's closing '》', there's an else statement. Then after that else, there's another '》' which is unexpected because it's not closed by anything.

Ah, so the problem is that the code has a trailing '》' at the end of the line after the else clause. That extra bracket isn't part of any block and causes a syntax error.

So to fix this, I should remove the trailing '》'. Let me visualize:

After fixing, it should be:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in standard code, if you have an else after an if without braces, it's invalid because you need a block. But maybe in this context, the styled brackets are intended to simulate block scoping.

So perhaps the correct approach is to not use the extra closing bracket at the end of the else line.

Alternatively, another way could be to properly structure the code with proper indentation and blocks.

But given that the error is about an unexpected '》', removing it should fix the problem. Let me check:

The original code ends with `》` after the else statement, which doesn't belong there. So by deleting that last closing styled bracket, the syntax becomes correct.
...done thinking.

To fix the code, remove the trailing styled closing bracket after the else clause to resolve the syntax error.

```fix
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
