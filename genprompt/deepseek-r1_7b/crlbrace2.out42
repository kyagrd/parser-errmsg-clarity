Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Wait, so there's an if statement that closes with }, then an else without any condition. But in this case, after the else, there's another}; which might be causing the issue.

I remember that when you have an else clause, it should correspond to the nearest if statement, and both must be properly closed with their own braces. In this code, the outer if is inside curly braces, so the else should also be part of that block.

Looking at the code structure: after the if condition, there's a block {a=1;}, then an else followed by b=2;. But since the else doesn't have its own braces and isn't indented correctly, maybe it's not properly connected to the if statement. Or perhaps the extra closing brace is causing the error.

Wait, actually, looking at the code, after the if block closes with }, there's an else clause which starts without a condition. Then, the code ends with another}; which might be incorrect because the else doesn't have its own braces and isn't matching the outer if correctly.

So the problem is that the else is not properly associated with the if statement. Also, the extra closing brace at the end is causing an unexpected '}' error.

To fix this, I should ensure that both the if and else clauses are part of the same block and properly closed. Let me restructure it:

1. The outer if condition should have its body inside braces.
2. The else should be attached to this if statement's brace block.
3. Remove any extra closing braces.

So rewriting the code: After the if block, instead of having an else without a condition, I can place the else within the same block or correctly structure it with proper indentation and braces.

Wait, but in some languages like C, you can have else without a condition only when using it after a for loop's closing brace. But here, looking at the code, maybe the user is using a different syntax where else must be properly aligned.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be an if-else statement inside another block, but due to incorrect indentation or braces, it's causing issues.

Another approach: Combine both conditions into one line if possible. But since x and y are different variables, maybe that's not feasible. So better to structure them correctly with proper braces.

Wait, perhaps the code should be rewritten so that after the if block closes with }, the else is placed within that same block but on a new line or properly indented, followed by its statement. But since in some languages you can't have an else without an if condition unless it's part of another structure.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But looking at the original code, after the first }, there was an else followed by b=2; and then another }. So perhaps the extra } is causing the error.

So I'll correct it by ensuring that both if and else are properly closed with their own braces. Let me see:

The corrected code should have the outer if statement's brace block containing the a=1; and inside, after closing }, an else followed by its own brace block for b=2;. But in the original code, there was another } at the end which isn't needed.

Wait, let me re-express it step by step:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Breakdown:
- if condition: x>0
- body: { a=1; }
- else: without an if condition? No, that's not correct. The else must be part of the same if statement.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So in this case, both the if and else have their own braces blocks. So the code after fixing should remove the extra } at the end.

In the original code, after the first }, then else, which isn't preceded by an if condition (it's just a standalone else), but that would be invalid because else must follow an if or elseif in Python, but in this case, perhaps it's another syntax. Alternatively, maybe the user is using JavaScript-like syntax where else can have its own block.

Wait, no, in JavaScript, you can't write else without an if condition unless it's part of a different structure, like catch blocks, which isn't applicable here.

So perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that both clauses are within the same brace block. Therefore, I'll adjust the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
