Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds familiar. Let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Wait, so there's an if statement followed by an else clause. But I see two closing brackets ']' here. The first one after the if condition closes the if block correctly. Then, the else clause is written as `else b = 2; ]` with another ] at the end.

The error message says there's an unexpected ] after the else clause because the if statement was already closed by the first ]. So I think the second ] is causing a problem here. It looks like it's not needed and might be a mistake.

Let me break down the code step by step. The correct structure should have the if block, then the else part without an extra ].

So the original code has:
- `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]` which seems okay because the opening bracket after the if is closed with ], making it a single-line statement inside the if.
- Then `else b = 2; ]` Here, I see that the else clause ends with ], but since the if was already closed by the first ], this extra ] isn't needed and is causing an error.

So to fix this, I should remove the extra ]. That means the corrected code would have only one closing bracket at the end of the else part.

Let me visualize it:
- The if block: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`
- Then, without any more brackets for else because the first ] already closed the if statement.
- So the else should be followed by `else b = 2;` and that's it.

Putting it all together, the fixed code would remove the trailing ] after else. Let me write that out:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

Yes, that should fix the syntax error because now there are no extra brackets causing confusion.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing bracket `]` which is not needed. Removing this will fix the syntax error.

```fix
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
