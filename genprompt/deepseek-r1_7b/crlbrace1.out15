Thinking...
Alright, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some JavaScript code. The user provided an error message and the code that's causing the issue. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the error message says: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, okay, so somewhere there's an extra curly brace or a missing one. I remember that in JavaScript, when you have an if-else statement, each block should be enclosed within curly braces { } for blocks.

Looking at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I notice that after the else clause, there's another closing brace. Let me parse this out. The if statement is correctly opened with { and closed with }, which contains the assignment `a=1`. Then comes an else statement followed by `b=2` but it's outside of any block because there's no opening brace for the else part.

Wait, so the code after the if-else isn't indented. In JavaScript, each conditional clause (if, else) should have its own block. So the else should be part of a separate block, which means another { } around `b=2`.

So in the current code, the structure is:

- if block: { ... }
- else statement followed by ; but then there's an extra } at the end.

Putting it all together, the code has two closing braces where they shouldn't be. Let me count them again.

The correct structure should be:

if (condition) { ... }
else { ... }

So in the given code, after the if block is closed, the else clause doesn't have its own block and instead ends with a semicolon, then there's an extra closing brace. That's why the error says "unexpected }" because there are too many braces.

To fix this, I need to add { around the else part so that both if and else have their own blocks. Let me rewrite the code accordingly.

So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }

This way, each conditional statement has its own block with proper braces. That should eliminate the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }
```
