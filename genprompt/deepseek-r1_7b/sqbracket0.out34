Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where the user wants to fix a syntax error in their code. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And the output should be fixed code inside triple backticks without using any pre-trained knowledge except the given error message.

First, I need to figure out what's wrong with the code. The error message says there's a syntax error. So I'll look at the code line by line.

The code starts with an if statement: if (x > 0) [ ... ]. Wait, after the parenthesis for the condition, they have square brackets instead of braces. In Python, we use {} for dictionaries and [] isn't valid there. But looking at this, it's part of a conditional expression or maybe inside another structure.

Then, in the code, inside the if block, there's [ a = 1; ] which doesn't make sense because in Python, semicolons are used to separate statements, not like in other languages where they might be used for annotations. Also, in an if statement without braces, you can only have one line. But here, after the condition, there's another block starting with else.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the structure is incorrect. The code has if (x > 0) followed by [ a = 1; ] and then else b = 2; ]. That seems like it's trying to use an array or list with square brackets in the condition, which isn't valid syntax.

So, the main issues are:
1. Using [] instead of {} for the if-else structure.
2. The code after the condition is not correctly structured because they're using ] and [ incorrectly, leading to a syntax error.

I think the user intended to write something like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in their code, it's missing the braces {} around each block. So I'll need to add those.

Looking at the code again: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I see that after the condition, they have square brackets enclosing a=1;, but this is not valid syntax for an if statement in Python. The correct way is to use {} or just write each line as separate statements.

So I'll replace the [] with {}, and adjust the indentation so that both the if block and else block are correctly placed under their respective conditions.

Therefore, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

I need to make sure there's no trailing semicolon at the end of each line because Python uses indentation for blocks. So I'll remove those semicolons and adjust the parentheses correctly.

So putting it all together, the fixed code inside triple backticks would look like this.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
