Thinking...
Okay, so I have this Python code that's causing a syntax error. Let me take a look at it. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, first off, I know that in Python, the if statement needs to be followed by an indented block of code for the true case and then optionally another indented block for the false case. So, right now, after the if condition, there's a @ symbol before the assignment. That doesn't look right.

Wait, maybe that line is supposed to have both conditions: one for when x > 0 and another for else. But in Python, you can't write an if statement with just two lines like that without proper indentation or using elif and else keywords.

Looking at the code, I see there's a semicolon after each line inside the if block, which is unnecessary because it's only one line. So maybe those semicolons are causing issues? Or perhaps they're not needed.

Also, the @ symbol before a = 1 looks strange. In Python, you can't just use @ followed by an assignment like that in an expression. Maybe that was meant to be something else, but I'm not sure what. It might have been intended for decorators or maybe it's part of some other syntax.

Then there are the comments after each line: # else b = 2; and another # at the end. In Python, comments start with #, so those should be okay as long as they're properly indented within their respective lines.

Wait, but in an if statement, you need to have both branches—so true block and false block. Here, it seems like only the true block is present because of that @ symbol. So perhaps I'm supposed to fix this by adding a proper else clause.

Let me think: maybe the code was intended to be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in the original, it's trying to use @ which doesn't fit here. So perhaps that line should just have 'a = 1' and then an else block.

So, removing the @ symbol from the first line and adding an else clause with the second assignment.

Also, I need to make sure there are no extra semicolons unless they're necessary for some reason. But in Python, inside a block, you don't end lines with semicolons except when using multiple statements on one line with appropriate operators like += or &=.

But here, each statement is separate: assignment and then another assignment after else. So the correct approach would be to structure it into an if-else block without the @ symbol.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should have proper indentation for both blocks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
