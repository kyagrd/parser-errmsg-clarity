Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this code. So, the user provided some code that's causing a syntax error and an error message saying "syntax error." The code given is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the programming language this code is in, but it looks like some sort of conditional statement. The keywords here are if and else, so probably JavaScript or something similar.

Looking at the structure, there's an if condition: (x > 0). Then, after that, there are these characters 《 and 》 which I don't recognize as standard operators or keywords in JavaScript. Instead, I see semicolons and another else statement with b = 2; but then there's a closing brace 》 at the end, which doesn't match up.

Wait, maybe those 《 and 》 are supposed to be brackets? In JavaScript, we use parentheses for conditions, square brackets for arrays or object literals, curly braces for blocks. So perhaps replacing the angle brackets with square brackets would fix it.

Let me rewrite the code step by step. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So inside the if statement, there's 《 a=1; 》 which should probably be an array or object literal. If I replace those with square brackets [], it becomes [a=1]. Then, outside the if-else block, there's another ] at the end, but looking at the code again, maybe that's misplaced.

Wait, actually, in JavaScript, after the else clause, you just need a semicolon or nothing. But here, the structure seems off because of the extra closing brace. Let me count the braces to see where they are.

The original code has:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after the if block, there's an else statement with its own semicolon and then another closing brace at the end. That doesn't make sense because each if-else block should be enclosed within curly braces.

Wait, maybe those angle brackets were meant to be part of an array or object literal. So inside the if block, instead of 《 a =1; 》, it's supposed to be [a=1]. Then after else b=2;, there shouldn't be another brace because that would close the entire outer if-else block twice.

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0) [a = 1]; else b = 2;

This way, inside the if statement, a is assigned 1 when x>0, and in the else case, b is assigned 2. The outer braces aren't needed because we're using semicolons to separate statements.

I think that's it. Replacing the angle brackets with square brackets fixes the syntax error, and removing the extra closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to mismatched delimiters and improper use of braces. The angle brackets (《 》) are not recognized as valid in JavaScript/TypeScript for defining arrays or objects. Instead, we should use square brackets [].

Here's the fixed code:

if (x > 0) [a = 1]; else b = 2;

This assumes that `a` is meant to be an array literal and `b` a variable value in the else clause.
