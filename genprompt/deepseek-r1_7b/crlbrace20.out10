Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error is a syntax error, so something's wrong with the code structure. Let me look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, looking at this, I notice that after the if statement, there's an else block but it seems incomplete. The code inside the if is correct: `a = 1;` because the semicolon is present. Then there's an else followed by `b = 2; }`. Wait, the else doesn't have a block after it. In many programming languages, like C or Java, you need to enclose the statements under else in curly braces. So here, the else statement only has one line without braces, which might not be causing an error, but I think the main issue is that there's an extra closing brace at the end.

Wait, let me check: The code starts with if (x>0) { a=1; }, then else b=2; and ends with another }. So the structure is:

if (...) {
    statement;
} else statement;

But in this case, the else statement doesn't have its own block. Depending on the language, that might not be allowed or could cause an error. However, looking at the code, it's more likely that there's an extra closing brace after the else, causing a syntax error because the number of braces isn't matching.

Let me count the opening and closing braces:

- The if starts with {.
- Then inside is `a=1;`.
- Then } closes the if block.
- Next is else b=2;
- Then another }, which would close something that's not opened yet. Wait, no: the else doesn't have its own block, so after else, it should end with a semicolon and then another statement. But in this code, the else ends without braces, but then there's an extra } at the end.

Wait, actually, looking again:

The code is written as:
if (x>0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block closes with }, then else and statement. Then another } at the end. So that would mean there's an extra closing brace after the else.

Wait, but in many languages, you can't have an else without a corresponding block, unless it's just one statement. But sometimes, people use braces even for single statements to make it consistent. Alternatively, maybe the code is using JavaScript or another language where else can be followed by a semicolon if there are no braces.

But regardless, in this case, the extra } at the end would cause a syntax error because it's closing more than one block. So I think the issue is that after the else statement, there should be an opening brace for its body, but looking at the code, perhaps the user forgot to add the { for the else part.

Wait no, in the given code, after else b=2;, the next line has a }, which would close either the if or another block. Let me re-express:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a = 1; } 

So this is correct up to the first }

Then Line 3: else b = 2;

But in many languages, you can't have an else statement without a corresponding block unless it's on its own line with braces. Alternatively, maybe the code was intended to be written as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

In this case, both if and else have their own blocks. So perhaps the correct fix is to add an opening brace after else.

But in the given code, there's no opening brace after else. So adding { would fix it.

Wait, but looking at the original code: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

So after else b=2; comes another }, which is incorrect because it closes something that isn't opened yet. But in this case, perhaps the user intended to have both if and else with blocks, but forgot to include them.

Alternatively, maybe the code was meant to be like:

if (x>0) {
    a =1;
} else
    b=2;

But without braces, that's allowed in some languages where statements are single-line. But then the issue is the extra } at the end.

Wait, no: If I have if (...) { ... } else statement; }, it would cause an error because there's an extra closing brace after else. So perhaps the correct fix is to remove the last }, so that only one block closes at the end.

So in the given code:

After `else b=2;`, there's a }, which is trying to close the if's block, but it was already closed by the first }. So adding an extra } after else would cause mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to have both if and else with their own blocks.

So let me think: The correct code should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a =1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

In this case, each block has its own { }, so two opening braces after if and else. But in the original code, only one } is present at the end, which closes both blocks.

Wait no: The given code starts with { after if, then ends that { ... } for if, then else b=2; } ends another }, but perhaps it's incorrect because the else doesn't have a block. So maybe adding braces to else would fix it.

Alternatively, considering the error message is "syntax error", perhaps the problem is that there are two closing braces in a row. Looking at the code:

The line after else b=2; ends with }, which might be followed by another } from elsewhere.

Wait no: Let me parse the code correctly.

Line 1: if (x>0) { a = 1; }

So this is one opening brace, then inside, and then closes it on line ?

Then line 3: else b=2;

Then line 4: }

Which would be after else, so that's another closing brace. But in the code as written, perhaps there are two } at the end.

Wait, looking back:

The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So line by line:

- if condition, opening brace,
- statement inside,
- closing brace on line ?
- else
- statement without braces: b=2;
- then another }, which would be the end of the entire code.

Wait, but in this case, after else and b=2;, there's an } to close something. But what was opened before? The if block was closed with one { ... }, so that } is line 3 or whatever, but here it seems like the code ends with another }, making two closing braces: one for the if and then another for nothing.

Wait no, perhaps in the original code, after else b=2;, there's an additional }, which would cause a mismatch. So to fix this, we can either remove that last } or add opening braces where necessary.

But since the user is asking to use only the error message symbols, which are probably { and }, I think adding the missing brace for the else statement.

So in the given code, after else b=2;, there's an extra }, but perhaps it should be { ... } around the else clause. So the correct fix would be:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Alternatively, if we can't change braces and just add a semicolon or something, but probably adding the opening brace after else is better.

Wait, but in the original code, it's written as `else b = 2; }` which has an extra }, so perhaps removing that last } would fix it. But I think the real issue is that the else statement should have its own block. So to make it correct, we can enclose the else part in braces.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But looking at the original code again: The user wrote `else b = 2; }` which ends with }, so perhaps they meant to close an if block but it's not correct. So adding another { after else would fix it.

Wait, maybe the correct way is:

if (x >0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

Which uses two opening and closing braces: one for if, and one for else.

So in the original code, perhaps they have an extra } at the end which should be removed. So the original code's mistake is having an extra }, but another way to look is that after else, it doesn't have a block, leading to syntax error because something was not closed properly.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of this differently. The code given has:

if (x>0) {a=1; } else b=2; }

So the first line opens and closes correctly: if ... { a=1; }, but then after that, it's else statement followed by another }, which is incorrect because only one block was opened before.

Wait no: The code starts with if (...) { ... }, so the opening brace is at line 3 (assuming each part is on separate lines). Then inside, a=1;. Then } closes the if block. So after that, else b=2; and another }. But in this case, there's an extra }, which would close something that wasn't opened, possibly causing a syntax error.

But perhaps it's better to count the number of opening and closing braces.

The code has:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a =1; }

So one opening brace at start, then inside, then line where } closes it. Then next is else b=2; on its own line. Then another }, which would try to close the previous block, but perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the code was intended to have an else without braces, like in JavaScript or some other languages where you can write:

if (x>0) a=1 else b=2;

But in that case, it's more of a one-liner. So if we interpret this as such, perhaps the correct code is:

if(x > 0)a =1; else b=2;

Wait, but then the code would be: 

if (x>0) {a=1; } else b=2;

But that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to have both if and else with their own blocks. So adding braces where necessary.

So given all this, I think the main error is that after else, there's no opening brace for its block. So to fix it, we need to add { before else b=2; so that it has a body.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Which adds braces around both conditions.

So putting it all together, I think adding an opening brace after else and closing with } would fix the syntax error. So the fixed code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait no, because that's not correct as there's no opening brace for else.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code had an extra }, so removing it would fix the issue. Let me check: The original code ends with } which is after else b=2;. So if we remove that last }, then the code becomes:

if (x>0) {a=1; } else b=2;

But in this case, perhaps it's still a syntax error because else doesn't have braces. But maybe some languages allow else without braces for single statements.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to enclose else with braces. So adding {b=2;} after else.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The original code:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b = 2; }

This has an extra }, so let's count the opening and closing braces.

- Line 1: if (...) { ... } - one opening, one closing.
- Then line 3: else statement
- Then another } which would be for something that hasn't been opened. So perhaps this is incorrect because there are two closing braces but only one opening brace after else.

Wait no, the first if has a block, so its opening and closing are balanced. The else statement comes after, but without any opening brace, so it's not part of any block. Then the final } would try to close that unopened else, which is invalid because you can't have an else with no body in most languages.

Therefore, the mistake is that the else does not have a body (i.e., braces around its statement). So to fix this, we need to add { and } after else so that it has a block.

So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But looking back at the original code, perhaps just adding an opening brace after else would suffice. Alternatively, if we can't change the number of braces but only add symbols from the error message, which are likely { and }, then maybe the correct fix is to add an opening brace for else.

Wait, but in the given code, it's written as:

else b = 2; }

So perhaps the user intended to have the else without braces, but that's invalid. Alternatively, adding another } at the end would make more sense if they meant to close both blocks.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The main syntax error is the extra }, so perhaps removing it or adjusting the braces around else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code should be:

if (x > 0) {a =1;} else b=2;

But that's without any braces for else, which might not be valid in some languages but could be allowed in others. However, I think the most common fix is to enclose else with its own block.

So considering all this, the best way to fix it is to add an opening brace after else and close it properly.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to an extra closing brace at the end which doesn't correspond to any opened block. To fix this, ensure each statement inside if or else is enclosed within its own braces.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Identify that the original code ends with two closing braces (`}`), causing a syntax error.
2. Add an opening brace `{` after the `else` keyword to create a block for the else statement.
3. Close this new block with another `}` at the end of the if-else structure.

Fixed code:
```  
if (x > 0) {a =1;} else {b=2;}
```
