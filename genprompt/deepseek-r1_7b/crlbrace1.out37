Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The user provided an error message and some code. Let me see what's going on here.

The error is "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that means somewhere there's an extra closing brace or the braces are mismatched. Let me look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, breaking it down. The code starts with an if statement: if (x>0), then there's { a=1; }, followed by else and then b=2;, and then another }. Wait, that last } is probably the issue.

So the structure should be:

if (condition) {
  statements;
} else {
  statements;
}

But in the given code, after the else statement, they have an extra closing brace. Let me count the braces. The if block has one opening { and one }, then after else b=2;, there's another }. So that makes two } at the end.

Looking back at the code:

- Line 1: if (x>0) {
- Line 2: a =1;
- Line3: }
- Then else
- Line5: b=2;
- Line6: }

Wait, so after the else statement, which is line4 and line5? Or maybe it's on the same line as }?

Actually, in the code provided, it's written as:

if (x>0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that's one if block with }, then else without braces, then another statement. But that can't be right because else needs to have its own braces.

Wait no, in the code given by the user, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block closes with }, then else is followed by b=2; and another }. So that means there are two closing braces at the end. The first } ends the if statement, then the second } tries to close something else, but it's not part of any block.

That's probably why the error says unexpected '}' after else. Because else doesn't have a block, so you can't have a single }, and here they have an extra one that closes incorrectly.

So the fix is to make sure each statement inside if and else has its own braces properly closed.

Looking at the code again:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

The user also had an extra closing brace after else, which was }

Wait no, looking back: the code ends with } }, so that's two closing braces. So in reality, it's if { ... } else statement followed by another }, but since else doesn't have a block, that second } is causing the error.

So to fix this, I think we should properly structure each block with braces.

Let me reformat the code correctly:

if (x>0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that's better. Each condition has its own brace block. So removing the extra closing } at the end and adding braces around else clause should fix it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```
