Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code snippet provided by the user:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

And the error message is: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Hmm, okay, so there's an issue with the braces here.

First, I notice that the if statement starts with an opening brace '{' right after the condition. That seems a bit odd because in many languages like Java or Python, you don't include that extra brace. But according to the error message, it's expecting another '}' but there isn't one before the else clause.

Wait, so let me parse this code step by step. The if statement is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

That part looks okay—it has an opening brace after the condition and some code inside. Then comes the 'else' keyword followed by b = 2; }.

But here's the problem: the else clause is outside of any closing brace. So, the structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }

Wait, no, because in the original code, it's written as:

} else b = 2; }

So, after the if block closes with }, there's an 'else' and then another statement without braces. That's incorrect syntax because the else should be part of the if statement.

I think the user intended to write a single-line conditional where both branches are in one line each but properly enclosed within braces for readability or some other reason. But as it stands, the code is causing an error because there are two closing braces: one after the if condition and another at the end which isn't needed.

Looking back, perhaps the user meant to have else { b = 2; } instead of just else followed by a statement without braces. So, removing the extra '}' before else would fix it. Let me check that:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That should be correct because now both branches have their own braces and only one closing brace is needed at the end of the if statement.

Alternatively, maybe they just need to close the else with a brace but in this case, since it's a single line, adding braces around 'b=2' would make it syntactically correct.

But considering the error message about an unexpected '}', I think removing the extra closing brace before else is sufficient. So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense because after the initial if block closes with }, there's no need for another one since the else statement only has 'b=2' which doesn't require braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
