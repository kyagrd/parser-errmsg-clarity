Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in a code snippet. The user provided an error message and some code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

The error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like there's a character that doesn't belong here. I remember seeing these symbols before; 《 and 》 are full-width brackets used in some languages, maybe Chinese or something. In English code, we usually use regular '<' and '>'.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I notice that after the 'else', there's another 》 before the semicolon. So maybe that extra closing bracket is causing the issue. The if statement seems to have its own brackets, so adding another one after 'else' might be incorrect.

Let me think about how this code should look without those brackets. In a typical structure, it would be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
elif else:
    b = 2;

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The original code has an 'else' clause, so after the if block ends with its closing bracket, we can have an else statement without any brackets because it's part of the same if-else structure.

So in this case, removing the extra 》 and matching the semicolon correctly should fix it.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) 《a = 1;》 else b = 2;

Wait, but I think using regular < and > might actually work better in this context. Maybe the initial code uses full-width brackets by mistake. So replacing those with standard '<' and '>' could resolve the issue.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) <a = 1;> else b = 2;

That way, the if statement is closed properly, followed by an else clause without extra brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) <a = 1;?> else b = 2;
```
