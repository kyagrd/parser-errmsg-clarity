Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code with a syntax error and an error message pointing out the issue. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, first off, looking at the structure, it seems like there's an if statement followed by some other lines using '#' which usually denotes comments in C-like languages. But here, since we're probably dealing with something like JavaScript or another language that allows comments inline, maybe the problem is elsewhere.

I notice that after the if condition, there's an @ symbol before 'a = 1'. In many programming languages, like JavaScript, the @ symbol isn't a valid operator. It might be causing a syntax error because it's being used incorrectly here. Maybe instead of @, it should be something else like = for assignment or perhaps another keyword.

Also, looking at the entire line: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The # is typically used to start comments in some languages, but here it's being placed at the end of each line. That could be causing issues because maybe the code isn't structured correctly with proper indentation or line breaks.

Wait, perhaps the original intention was to have two separate statements: one inside the if condition and another outside. So maybe the @ should just be a regular operator like =. Let me think about how this might look in a language that allows for such syntax. Oh right, in JavaScript, you can write inline operations using semicolons, but here the # is messing things up.

So perhaps the code was intended to have:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But with incorrect line breaks and operators. The @ should be replaced with an assignment operator like =.

Also, the use of # for comments is causing the lines to end abruptly, so I need to remove those or adjust their placement.

So putting it all together, replacing @ with = and removing the # signs before the semicolons so that each line ends properly. That should fix the syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
