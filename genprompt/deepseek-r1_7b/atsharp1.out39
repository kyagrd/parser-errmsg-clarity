Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. Let me see what it is. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, looking at the error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause". So there's something wrong with the else part.

I remember that in Ruby, when you write an if-else block using the if statement, you need to close it properly. In this code, the line starts with @ a = 1; which might be part of some method or class. Then after the closing parenthesis for the condition, there's a # else... So maybe that's where the issue is.

Wait, in Ruby, when using if-else inside a block, you can use braces to enclose both cases. But here, it looks like they're trying to do something with the @ and # operators. Oh right! In Ruby, the @ symbol starts an inject method or a block. So maybe they meant to write:

if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else
  @b = 2
end

But in the original code, it's written as if each line is separate with semicolons after # symbols. That doesn't seem right.

So the problem is that the else clause isn't properly closed. The current code has # between the end of the condition and else. Instead, they should use braces {} to enclose both blocks.

Let me try rewriting it. I'll replace the @a = 1; with a block using { }, then do the same for else. So:

if (x > 0) {
  @a = 1;
} else {
  @b = 2;
}

That should fix the syntax error because now everything is properly enclosed within braces, and there are no # symbols after the else clause.

I think that's it. The key was to use braces for the if-else block instead of using semicolons with comments.
...done thinking.

The code had an incorrect structure around the if-else statement. Using curly braces `{}` correctly encloses the statements within the conditional blocks, eliminating the syntax error related to the '#' symbol.

```ruby
if (x > 0) {
  @a = 1;
} else {
  @b = 2;
}
```

The fixed code uses proper block syntax with curly braces for both the if and else clauses.
