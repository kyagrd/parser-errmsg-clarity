Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm looking at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Hmm, that suggests a missing bracket somewhere.

First, let me examine the structure of the code. The if statement starts with `(x > 0)`, then has `[ a = 1; ]` which looks like a block inside the if condition. Then outside the if, it's `else b = 2; ]`. Wait, that last ']' is probably causing the issue because there's no corresponding opening bracket for it.

So, where should I place this closing bracket? The else clause doesn't have any curly braces, so maybe adding them would help. Let me adjust the code to include `{}` around both if and else parts.

Rewriting the code with braces:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Now, I check for any extra brackets or missing ones. It looks good—each block has its opening and closing curly braces, so the syntax error should be resolved.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing bracket without a corresponding opening one. Adding the correct braces fixes this.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
