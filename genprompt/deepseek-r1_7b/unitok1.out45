Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause of an if statement which already closed. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Wait, I notice that in the user's message, they used "》" with straight lines instead of actual closing brackets. But looking back, their example shows that after else, there's another '》'. So maybe it's actually using angle brackets or something similar.

But in standard syntax, if you have an if statement followed by an else clause, the structure is usually like:

if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

So in this case, the user has "if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2; 》". It looks like they're using '《' and '》' instead of curly braces. Wait, but those are not correct because curly braces should be used for blocks.

I think the problem is that after the if statement's condition closes with ), then there's an unexpected 《 which might be considered as a block start where it shouldn't be. Then inside, they have 'a=1;' followed by 》. But since the outer brackets are already closed before else, maybe the code is misplacing these angle brackets.

Wait, no, in standard syntax, you don't use angle brackets for code blocks. You use curly braces {}. So perhaps those '《' and '》' are actually intended to be curly braces but are appearing as separate characters because of encoding issues or typos.

So looking at the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests that right after the else, there's a 》 which is unexpected. So maybe the code has an extra closing bracket where it shouldn't.

Wait, let me parse the code correctly. The original code is:

if (x>0) 《 a =1; 》 else b=2; 》

So breaking it down: after the if statement's closing ), there's '《', then inside that block, which isn't correct because in standard syntax you can't have a single line with a semicolon and angle brackets. Then another }.

Wait no, actually, maybe they're using '《' as a comment or something else, but I think it's more likely that the code is incorrectly placing these characters. So perhaps replacing those 《 and 》 with curly braces {} would fix it.

So let me try to rewrite the code correctly. The correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a =1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

But in the original code, they have '《' before a=1; and '》' after. So I think replacing those with { and } would fix it.

So the corrected code is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

Alternatively, using more appropriate formatting for readability:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in terms of just fixing the syntax error by replacing '《' and '》' with {}.

I think that's the fix. So I'll provide the code with curly braces.
...done thinking.

The original code has mismatched angle brackets which should be replaced with curly braces to form proper block structures. Here's the fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

or more concisely:

```fix
if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;
```

The key fix was replacing the incorrect angle brackets with proper curly braces to denote code blocks.
