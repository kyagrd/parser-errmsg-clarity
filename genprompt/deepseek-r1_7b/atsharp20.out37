Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there are these symbols @ and # in there. In many programming languages like C or Java, the @ symbol isn't used inside if statements. So maybe that's part of the problem.

Also, at the end of each line, there's a # after some code. That doesn't look right because usually, you don't put comments directly after code lines without any space in such contexts. Maybe those are meant to be comments but misplaced.

So breaking it down, the first line is an if statement checking if x is greater than 0. Then there's @ a =1; which probably isn't valid syntax anywhere I know. The # symbols at the end of each line might be acting as comments or delimiters for something else, but they're not placed correctly.

I think what the user is trying to do here is write an if-else statement where inside the if block, a variable 'a' is set to 1, and in the else block, 'b' is set to 2. So the code should look more like:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}

But looking back at the original code, there are some extra symbols and misplaced comments. So I need to remove those @ and # symbols and adjust where they are placed.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should have the if statement with proper braces on each line and no extraneous characters like @ or #.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by the incorrect use of `@` and `#` symbols. Removing these and properly indenting the code block fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
