Thinking...
Alright, let's see. I have to fix this syntax error in the given code using only the error message provided. The error is about an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Hmm.

Looking at the code: 

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So, it seems like there are these symbols 《 and 》 which look similar to angle brackets but aren't standard in JavaScript or Python. The error says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause.

In JavaScript, we use parentheses for function calls and control structures. So maybe those 《 and 》 should be regular parentheses instead? Let me check: if I replace them with normal (), does that make sense?

The original code is trying to have some expressions inside the if-else. But in JS, you don't put semicolons after conditions unless it's an IIFE or something else. So maybe 'a = 1;' and 'b = 2;' are supposed to be part of the conditionals.

Wait, but the way it's written now is:

if (x > 0)《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So between if and else, there are these brackets. If I change those to parentheses, maybe that will fix it because in JS you don't need them around expressions like assignments unless they're part of an expression statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be using logical OR or something else but got confused with these custom brackets. Since 《 and 》 are not recognized syntax, replacing them with () would make the code valid.

So changing:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》

to 

if (x > 0)(a = 1;) 

and then the else part:

else b = 2;

But wait, how to structure it? Maybe as two separate lines with proper indentation. So perhaps the correct code would be:

if ((x > 0)) { a = 1; } 
else {
   b = 2;
}

Wait, but the user's original code doesn't have braces. Maybe they were intended to be single-line conditionals. Alternatively, using parentheses around the assignment in the if and else parts.

But given the error message is about an unexpected '》' after else, it's likely that these custom brackets were causing issues. So replacing them with regular parentheses should fix it.

So I think the corrected code would replace both 《 with ( and 》 with ), resulting in:

if ((x > 0))(a = 1;) else (b = 2);

But maybe that's not correct because you don't need to enclose a statement in () unless it's part of another expression. Alternatively, perhaps the code was intended to be written as two separate lines without changing the brackets.

Alternatively, maybe the original intention was to use angle brackets for something else, but they're causing syntax errors. So using regular parentheses is better here.
...done thinking.

The error arises because the custom characters 《 and 》 are used where standard parentheses should be. Replacing them with proper parentheses fixes the syntax.

```javascript
if ((x > 0))(a = 1;) else (b = 2);
```
