Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an error message saying "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me look at the code they provided:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I see that the if statement is correctly opened with `{` and then closed with `}`. But wait, after the else clause, there's another `}` at the end of the code. That might be causing the issue.

Looking closer, the structure should be an if-else block where both branches are properly enclosed. In the original code, the first branch is inside curly braces `{}`, but the else part isn't. So it should be:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wait, no, in the given code, the else is followed by `b=2;` without curly braces. Then there's an extra closing brace at the end. So I think the mistake is that the else statement isn't properly enclosed and there's an extra `}`.

So to fix it, I should add `{}` around the else part so that each statement block is correctly enclosed within curly braces. That way, the code structure becomes valid.
...done thinking.

The error occurred because only the first branch had a block of code inside curly braces, while the second branch didn't have matching braces and there was an extra closing brace.

Here's the fixed code:
```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The fixed code adds braces to both branches of the if-else statement.
