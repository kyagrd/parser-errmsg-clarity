Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first off, the error message says there's a syntax error. I know in programming that brackets or parentheses are usually where these issues come from.

Looking at the code, I see "if (x > 0)" followed by some stuff inside these angle brackets: 《 a = 1; 》 Then another condition with else b = 2; and then another angle bracket closing it. Wait, that doesn't look right because in most programming languages like C or Java, the if-else structure uses curly braces for blocks.

So I think the problem is that they're using these angle brackets instead of curly braces. In PHP, which this might be (because the original code has semicolons and similar syntax), the correct way to write it would be with curly braces inside the if statement.

Let me break it down step by step:

1. The outer structure should be an if-else statement using curly braces.
2. Inside the if block, they have a = 1; so that should be enclosed in curly braces after the if condition.
3. Then the else part should also be inside its own set of curly braces.

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes, that makes sense now. The angle brackets were incorrect because they're not recognized in PHP for defining code blocks. Using curly braces instead should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code uses angle brackets which are not valid syntax in PHP. Instead, we need to use curly braces `{}` for the if-else structure.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Replace the angle brackets `《` and `》` with curly braces `{}` inside the if condition to properly enclose the block of code.
2. Similarly, replace the outer closing angle bracket with a curly brace to correctly close the if-else statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```php
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

**Corrected Code:**
```php
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
