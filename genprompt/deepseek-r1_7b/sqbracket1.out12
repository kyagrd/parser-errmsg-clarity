Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error message is "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me see what's going on here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I notice that there are brackets around the if condition. So it's written as `if (x > 0)[...`. Usually, in many programming languages like C or JavaScript, you don't use brackets around the condition. The user might be using a language where brackets are optional but allowed.

Then inside the brackets, we have an assignment `a = 1;` followed by a closing bracket `]`. That's correct so far because it's within the if block. Then there's an else clause: `else b = 2; ]`. Wait, after else, another semicolon and then a closing bracket.

The error message points to the unexpected ']' after the else clause. So maybe the extra closing bracket is causing the issue. Let me think about how this code should be structured without any errors.

In many languages, an if statement would look like:

if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

But in the given code, they're using brackets around the entire if block. So perhaps they intended to write something like:

if (x > 0)[a = 1;] else b = 2;

Without any extra closing brackets beyond what's necessary for the statements.

Wait, but let me count the brackets here. The original code has `[ ]` around the if condition and another `]` after else. So that might be adding an extra bracket which is causing a syntax error because it's not properly closed.

So maybe the correct way is to remove the extra closing bracket at the end of the else statement. Let me re-examine:

The code starts with `if (x > 0)[a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So after the else, there's an extra ']'. If I remove that, it should fix the syntax error.

Alternatively, perhaps they meant to have a single-line if-else without any blocks. In some languages, you can write:

if (x >0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

But in this code, they're using brackets which might not be necessary unless required by their specific language's syntax.

So the corrected code should remove the extra closing bracket after else.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)[ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
