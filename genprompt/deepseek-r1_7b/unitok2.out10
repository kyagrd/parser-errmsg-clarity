Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at what the user provided.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

And the error message says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed). Hmm, that makes me think there's an extra closing bracket.

Looking at the code, I see the if condition is correctly closed with 《...》. Then there's an else followed by b = 2; and another 》. So maybe the last 》 is causing the problem because it's not needed after else.

Wait, in some languages like C or Java, you don't put brackets around the body of if-else statements unless they have compound conditions. But here, the code seems to be using a different syntax where the closing bracket for the if statement might include both branches.

But actually, looking at it, perhaps the mistake is that after else, there's an extra 》 which isn't needed because the else block ends right after 'else b = 2;'. So I should remove the last 》 to fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
