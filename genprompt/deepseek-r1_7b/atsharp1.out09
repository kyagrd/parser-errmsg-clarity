Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's going on here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Alright, so there's an if statement that checks if x is greater than 0. Then there's this `@ a = 1;` right after it. Wait, in Ruby, the assignment operator is `=`, not `@`. So maybe that's part of the problem.

But then I see `# else b = 2; #` at the end. That looks like the start and end of a comment block because Ruby uses `#'s to denote comments. So perhaps someone tried to add an else statement but forgot to close the comment properly.

Wait, in Ruby, you can write code between `#'s as a comment. If I have `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` followed by `# else b = 2; #`, that might be causing issues because after the if statement's block ends, there's an else part inside comments which isn't valid.

So maybe the code is trying to write something like:

if x>0
  do something
else
  do something else
end

But with the incorrect use of `@` and improperly placed comments.

Let me break it down. The line `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` probably shouldn't have the `@`. So that's one mistake.

Then, after that line, there are two lines starting with `# else b=2; #`. That looks like an attempt to add an else clause but in comments. Since Ruby is a block structured language, you can't have an else outside of if without proper indentation and structure.

Wait, perhaps the intention was to write:

if (x > 0)
  @a =1
else 
  @b=2
end

But with some extra characters messing it up. So maybe they tried to put comments but didn't close them properly, leading to the parser getting confused about where else should be.

So to fix this, I need to remove any unnecessary parts and correct syntax errors. The `@` is incorrect; it's probably a typo for `=`.

Also, the code after the if statement has commented-out else clause, which might have caused confusion with Ruby's comment syntax.

Putting it all together:

- Remove the `@` in `@a =1`.
- Properly structure the else clause without using comments incorrectly.
- Close everything properly so that the if and else are correctly nested within each other.

So the corrected code should be:

```
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else 
  @b = 2
end
```

This way, it's a valid Ruby if statement with an else clause. I've removed the `@`, fixed the comment placement by not leaving any commented lines after, and properly indented the code.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there's an unexpected '#' used as part of a comment outside the intended if-else structure. The fix involves correcting the assignment operator from '@' to '=' and removing the misplaced comments.

```ruby
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else 
  @b = 2
end
```

The corrected code is:

```ruby
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else
  @b = 2
end
```

Here's the fixed code inside triple backticks:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
else @ b = 2;
```

Wait, actually, in my initial thought I made some mistakes. Let me correct that.

The proper fix should be:

```ruby
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else 
  @b = 2
end
```

So the final fixed code inside triple backticks is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else @ b = 2; end
```
