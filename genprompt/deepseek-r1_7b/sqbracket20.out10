Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code with a syntax error. Let me take a look at it. The code is written as:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there's an if statement. In many programming languages like C or Java, after an if condition, you have curly braces {} to enclose the block of code that should execute when the condition is true. But here, instead of { }, I see [ and ]. That's probably not right because those are square brackets, which aren't used for defining code blocks in these languages.

Looking at the structure: after the if statement, there's an else clause. So the syntax seems to be trying to handle both cases—when x is greater than 0 and when it's not. But the problem is with how the code blocks are defined.

In C or Java, you would write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in this case, they used square brackets instead of curly braces. So I think replacing [ and ] with { and } should fix the syntax error because those are the correct delimiters for code blocks.

Let me check again: after if (x >0), it's followed by a block inside square brackets, then else with another block in square brackets. That's not how it works. So changing them to curly braces should make sense.

Also, looking at the else statement, I notice that there might be an extra ] at the end of the code. The original code has two ] after the else line: ]

So perhaps that's a typo or leftover from using square brackets instead of curly braces. Removing one of those would fix it.

Putting it all together, I'll replace [ with { and ] with }, making sure to have only one set of curly braces around each statement block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
