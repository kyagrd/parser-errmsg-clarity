Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." So my first thought is that there's something wrong with the structure of the code lines given.

The code snippet they provided is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Hmm, let me break this down. The code starts with an if statement: if x is greater than 0, then it does something inside the curly braces. Then there's an else block where they try to assign b=2, but wait—the else isn't followed by a closing brace correctly.

Looking at the structure, after the if condition, the opening brace { for the if block closes properly, which is correct. But then comes the else statement without any condition, just `else b = 2;`. That's not right because in an else clause, there should be another condition following the keyword else, like else if something.

Wait, but looking at the code again: after the else, it's followed by a closing brace. So actually, the else is inside the first if block because of how the braces are placed. Let me visualize this:

The code as written:
if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But looking at the formatting, I see that after the else, there's another closing brace on the same line. So it's like: if (...) { ... } else b = 2; }

Wait, no—the code as written by the user has an extra closing brace at the end. Let me check again:

The code is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the else statement, there's another closing brace '}' on the next line, making it look like two separate blocks? Or maybe it's part of the same structure.

Wait no, in the original code, the if block starts with { and then a=1; }, but wait—no, looking more closely:

The user wrote: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }` So after the else statement, there's another closing brace. That would cause a syntax error because each block should be properly closed.

Wait no, perhaps it's not correctly indented or structured. Let me try to parse this:

The code is written as:
if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But then the user has an extra closing brace at the end: } So actually, the structure is incorrect.

Wait no, in the original code provided by the user, it's `if (...) { ... } else ...; }` with another closing brace. That would mean that after the else statement and its block, there's still a closing brace left. But let me count:

The first if has an opening brace at line 2: {
Then inside is a=1; }, which closes on line 3.

Wait no, looking back: The code as written by the user is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
So this would be:

Line 1: if (x>0) {
Line 2:   a=1;
Line3: }
Then line4: else b=2;
Line5: }

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the opening brace of the if is on line 2? Or wait, maybe it's all in one line.

No, looking again, perhaps the code is written as a single statement without proper braces.

Wait, let me think differently. The correct structure should have an else block with its own condition and curly braces. But in the given code, after the if-else structure, there's another closing brace at the end, which doesn't belong to either block. So that's causing a syntax error because it's not properly closed.

Alternatively, perhaps the else is attached incorrectly. Let me see: If you have an if statement followed by an else without any condition, that's not valid in some languages. But in others, like JavaScript or PHP, else can follow immediately without a condition as part of the same control structure.

Wait, but looking at this code:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

So after the if block closes with }, then comes 'else' and an assignment. That would be invalid because the else needs to be followed by another condition in some languages. But perhaps it's intended for JavaScript-like syntax where you can have else without a separate condition, but that's rare.

But I think the main issue here is the extra closing brace at the end of the code block after the else statement. Because when the user wrote:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

It ends with an extra '}' which isn't needed, causing a syntax error.

So to fix this, I should remove that last closing brace so that each block is properly closed. Let me check:

The correct code would be:
if (x >0) {a=1;}
else b=2;

But perhaps in the original code, it's written with an extra '}' at the end. So by removing the last '}', the code becomes valid.

So the corrected code is:

if (x>0) { a = 1; } else b=2;
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
