Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code again:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, so first off, I notice that the opening curly brace `{` after `else` is probably misplaced. In the original code, it's written as `else b=2; }`, but maybe there was an extra brace or missing one.

Wait, actually, looking closely, the code starts with `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. So after the `else`, there's no `{` before `b = 2;`. That must be the issue. The `else` statement should have its own block.

So I think the correct structure should be: if the condition is true, execute a block, else execute another block. But in the original code, it just has `a=1;` and then `else b=2;`, without braces around the second part. That's why there's a syntax error because the statements aren't properly enclosed.

To fix this, I should add `{` after `else` to start the else block and close both blocks with corresponding `}`. So it should look like:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That way, both the if and else statements have their own blocks enclosed in braces, which should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to misplaced braces. The `else` statement is followed by an incomplete block.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the issue:** The original code ends with `}` after `else b=2;`, but it's missing the opening `{`.
2. **Correct the structure:** Add `{` after `else` to start a new block, and ensure all blocks are properly closed.
3. **Resulting fixed code:** Both conditional statements now have their own blocks.

Here is the corrected code:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
