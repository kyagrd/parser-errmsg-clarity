Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with an error. The user is asking me to fix it based on the error message provided: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, I see that there's an if statement followed by an else. The syntax error is pointing to an unexpected closing brace, so probably a missing or extra bracket somewhere.

Looking at the code structure: the if condition is correctly enclosed in braces { }, which is good. Then after the if block, there's an else statement with its own assignment, and then another '; }' at the end.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the else clause isn't properly closed before the second closing brace. Let me see how many braces are there. The if has one opening { and one closing }, which closes after a=1;. Then the else is followed by b=2; but then there's another } at the end.

So, it looks like the code structure should be: if condition { ... } else { ... }, right? But in the current code, the else isn't enclosed in braces. So when the compiler or interpreter parses it, after the else clause ends, it expects a block but finds an extra closing brace instead.

Let me count the braces:

- The first if statement is from { to }, that's one pair.
- Then the else is outside any block, so its assignment starts at 'else b=2;'.
- But then there's another } after that. That means it's expecting a block for else but it didn't find it.

So probably, the code should have an opening brace for the else part as well. Let me try rewriting it:

The correct structure would be to enclose both the if and else parts in their own braces, or at least make sure that each clause is properly closed before another one starts.

Alternatively, maybe the else isn't supposed to have a block; perhaps just an assignment without braces. But since there's an else, usually you need a block unless it's a single statement.

Wait, looking back, after 'else b=2;' there's another '; }', which is causing the error because it's trying to close more than one brace.

So the problem is that there are two closing braces at the end: one for the else and then an extra one. Or perhaps the else isn't properly closed before the second brace comes in.

Wait, let me parse this line by line:

- 'if (x > 0) { a = 1; }' : That's correct, ends with }, so that's two braces opened and closed.
- Then 'else b=2;' : So after the first if block closes, we have else. But in the current code, after else comes 'b=2;' followed by another ';}'.

So perhaps the code is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

Which would be: if condition, then }, which ends the if block, then else, assignment, and then another }, which doesn't have anything to close. So that's why it's an error.

So the solution is to properly structure the code so that each clause (if, else) has its own braces if necessary, or ensure correct nesting.

In this case, perhaps the else should be followed by a block in braces. Let me adjust that.

Let me write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, would that fix the issue? Because now after the if statement's }, there's an else with its own {. So let me count the braces again.

- The if starts at {
- then inside is a=1;
- then } which closes the if.
- Then 'else {' : opens else block
- inside: b=2;
- then '}'

So that would have three { and three }, but no, wait:

No. The initial code had two ';' after else, but with braces.

Wait, let me correct myself. The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Which translates to: if condition { ... } else statement;

But the 'else' isn't followed by any block, so after }, it's else without braces.

Then in the corrected version, I need to add braces for the else part as well.

So let me write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Which should fix the error. Let me check: The if block is closed with }, then else has its own {}, so no extra } at the end. That should resolve the unexpected '}' after else clause.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have only one statement in each clause without braces, but that's less common. But since there was an error about expecting a brace, adding the braces for the else seems right.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
