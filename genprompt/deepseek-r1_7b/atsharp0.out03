Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and provided some code with comments. Let me look at the code carefully.

The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or using certain syntax highlighting tools, having multiple statements on one line can cause issues. The user's error message says "syntax error," which suggests there's something wrong with how the code is structured.

Looking at the code, I see an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then there are two commented lines: `@ a = 1;` and `else b = 2;`. Wait, in C or similar languages, the else clause comes after the if without any comments. But here, those comments are right after the if condition.

I remember that in some contexts, especially when using syntax highlighting tools like Black or Preprocessed-P pretty formatting, having code inside a comment can cause issues because it's treated as raw text instead of actual code. So maybe the @ symbol is causing an issue because it's outside of any meaningful code block.

So perhaps moving the comments above the if statement would fix this. That way, the @ and else statements are properly separated from the condition, preventing them from being part of the code structure that follows.

Let me try rearranging the code:

First, keep the if statement as is:
if (x > 0) { ... }

Then place the comments above it so they don't interfere with the syntax. So instead of having the @ and else after the if, I'll put them before or outside any brackets to avoid being mistaken for part of the code.

So the corrected code should be:

@ a = 1;
else b = 2;

if (x > 0) {
    // Some code here?
}

Wait, but in the original code, there was no block after if. Maybe that's another issue. But since the user only asked to fix the syntax error related to the comments and the structure, perhaps adding a comment inside the if isn't necessary unless it was intended.

But looking back at the problem statement, the output should only include the fixed code within triple backticks without any extra text. So I'll just arrange the statements correctly.
...done thinking.

The issue is that the comments are misplaced outside of the `if` condition block in a way that's causing syntax problems. To fix this, we move the comments above the `if` statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```
@ a = 1;
else b = 2;

if (x > 0) {
    // No closing bracket was present before, so added one
}
```
