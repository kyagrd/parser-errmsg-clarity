Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an example with specific instructions on how they want the code fixed. Let me try to understand what's going wrong here.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I know that in many programming languages like C or Java, an if-else statement should have braces `{}` for the body. So maybe this code is using a different syntax where they use square brackets instead of braces.

Looking at the line `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`, I see that after the else keyword, there's just `b = 2; ]` without any opening bracket. That would cause a syntax error because the closing bracket for the if statement isn't matched.

So to fix this, I should add an opening square bracket right after the else so that it correctly closes the block of code inside the if statement. Also, since there are two statements (the one with `a = 1` and the one without), we need both blocks enclosed within curly braces or another type of brackets.

Putting it all together, I'll change the structure to match what's needed for a proper if-else block with correct syntax. Using square brackets as in the original code makes sense here, so replacing the missing opening bracket should resolve the error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
