Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And they're asking to fix the syntax error using only the error message mentioned, which is "syntax error." 

First, I notice that in the code, there's an if statement with a condition (x>0). Inside the parentheses after the if, instead of having a block of code indented properly or on a new line, it has square brackets. So the line starts with [a=1;]. That doesn't look right because in many programming languages like C or Java, you can use square brackets for arrays, but here inside an if statement's condition parentheses, that's not valid.

Next, after the else clause, there's another line: ] else b = 2; ]. Wait, so there are two closing brackets. The first part is in the if block with [ and then at the end of the else part, it's adding another ]. That might cause a syntax error because each bracket should be properly closed.

Looking at how an if statement should look, usually it's like this:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

Or using parentheses:

if (x>0)(...) else (...)

But in the given code, it's mixing square brackets with parentheses, which is probably incorrect. Also, after the if condition, there are no braces or a new line for the code block inside.

So I think the problem here is that the square brackets are being used incorrectly instead of curly braces or nothing at all. Since in many languages like C or Java, you don't use square brackets with an if statement; they use curly braces. But perhaps in this context, the code expects just proper indentation and structure.

Another thing I notice is that there's a ] after the else line, which would cause an extra closing bracket without anything to close. So maybe the user intended to write either { for the block or nothing because it's using parentheses around the condition but then not correctly handling the body.

Putting this together, I think the fix involves removing the square brackets and ensuring that each statement is properly indented under its respective if-else clause. Also, there shouldn't be an extra closing bracket at the end.

So the corrected code would replace the [ with { after the if condition, remove any unnecessary brackets, and ensure proper indentation for the else block.
...done thinking.

The syntax error occurs because square brackets are used incorrectly instead of curly braces in an if statement structure. Additionally, there is an unmatched closing bracket. The fix involves replacing the square brackets with curly braces to properly define code blocks.

The corrected code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This removes unnecessary brackets and ensures proper indentation for both if and else clauses, fixing the syntax error.
