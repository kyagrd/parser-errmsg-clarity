Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet here with a syntax error. The user wants me to fix it without relying on my pre-trained knowledge of specific languages. Let's look at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I know that in most programming languages, if statements require both an if block and an else block if you have multiple conditions or branches. But here, it seems like the structure is off.

The first part is if (x>0) followed by {a=1;} which looks okay. Then there's an else with just b=2; but without braces at the end of the else clause. Wait, no, actually in this code, after else, they have b=2; and then a closing brace for the if statement.

Wait, let me parse it again. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So the if block ends with }, then there's an else followed by b=2;, but no braces around that? Or wait, actually, in some languages like Java or C++, you can write without braces for simple statements. But perhaps in this context, it's expecting a compound statement.

But looking at the syntax error message, which is just "syntax error," maybe there are two issues here: one is missing braces after else, and another is an extra closing brace that doesn't match.

Wait, let me count the braces:

1. if (x>0) { ... } 

So the if block has a single opening brace and then a statement inside. Then it ends with }, which would close the if condition.

Then there's else b=2; followed by another }. Wait, so after else, we have two closing braces? Or is it that the else doesn't have its own block?

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the else isn't properly closed or has an extra brace. Let me think about how this code would be structured correctly.

In many languages, each if-else statement requires braces for each block. So perhaps the correct structure is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

That way, both branches have their own blocks with braces.

So in the original code, after else, there's just b=2; without braces, which might be allowed in some cases but could cause issues. But more likely, the problem is that after the else statement, there's an extra closing brace at the end of the if-else structure.

Wait, let me check: The code ends with } so perhaps it's expecting two levels of braces, but only one was opened initially.

So maybe the fix is to add braces around the else clause. Let me try rewriting:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

This way, each condition has its own block with braces. Also, there's no extra closing brace at the end.

Alternatively, if the language allows single statements without braces in an if-else, but it's more common to include braces for clarity and to handle multi-line statements.

So I think adding braces around the else part would fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error because the `else` statement is missing its block of code. To fix this, add curly braces `{}` after the `else`.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The original code had an `else` clause without braces.
2. Adding `{ }` around `b = 2;` completes the `else` block and fixes the syntax error.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
