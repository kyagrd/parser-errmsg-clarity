Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message is "syntax error," so there's something wrong with the code structure or the use of operators.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I notice that after the if statement, there's an operator `@` before the assignment `a = 1`. That doesn't look right. In programming languages like C or Python, the `@` operator is used for decorators in Python or for function pointers in other contexts. But here, it seems out of place.

Next, after the if block, there's a comment `# else b = 2;` which might be intended as part of an else statement but isn't properly formatted. Also, the code ends with another `#`, making it look like multiple comments are present without any actual code in between.

So, I think the main issues are:
1. The use of the `@` operator where it's not appropriate.
2. The improper placement of the else statement after a comment.
3. Extra comments at the end that don't contribute to the logic.

To fix this, I'll remove the `@` operator and correctly place the else clause under the if statement. This should resolve the syntax error by ensuring each part is properly structured within the code block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
