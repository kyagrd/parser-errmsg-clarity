Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

First, the user provided an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That means somewhere there's a character that doesn't belong, specifically '》', which is probably a typo or incorrect symbol.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there are some characters. It starts with '《', which is likely meant to be a comment or something but isn't recognized correctly here. Then comes 'a=1;》', followed by another '》' at the end.

Wait, in many programming languages like Java and C, we use '/*' for comments. But looking closer, the code uses symbols that might resemble right-angle brackets. I recall that sometimes people mix up '《' as a comment start instead of using '//' or '/* ... */'.

But focusing on the error: it's complaining about an unexpected '》'. So perhaps those symbols are meant to be removed because they're not correct in this context.

Let me think about how if statements should look. The structure is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

So, after the condition's closing parenthesis, there should be a '{' or some block start, then inside curly braces for code. Alternatively, if using other syntax like semicolons, it would typically end with '}'.

In this case, the user is using 《 and 》 which are not standard in most languages except maybe Chinese or Japanese contexts, but here they're likely mistakes because the error says they shouldn't be there.

So, perhaps those brackets should be removed. Let me try removing them:

The original code after 'if (x>0)' has 《 a=1; 》 and then else b=2; followed by another 》.

Removing the 《 and 》 gives:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That makes more sense. It's a simple if-else statement where if x>0, set a to 1, else set b to 2.

So I think the solution is to remove those incorrect brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
