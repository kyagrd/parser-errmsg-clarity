Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code here with a syntax error, and I need to figure out how to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's provided. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The user gave an error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, that means there's a syntax issue in their code related to braces and an else statement. Looking at the code they provided:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that after the if statement, they have curly braces `{}`, which is correct for enclosing block statements in many languages like JavaScript or PHP. Then there's an else clause on the same line: `else b = 2;`, but without any curly braces and followed by another }.

Wait, let me count the braces. The code starts with if (x>0) { a=1; }, then else b=2; }, so that's three closing braces? Or is it two? Let me see:

The first line has `if (...) { ... }`, which uses one pair of braces correctly. Then, after the else statement, there's another }.

So the structure would be something like:

if (...) { a =1; }
else b=2;
}

Which means that the if-else is not properly closed. The code starts with an opening brace for the if condition but then closes it right after the assignment, which ends the if block. Then the else statement and its assignment are outside of any block because there's no opening brace before them.

So the error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause", meaning that when the compiler encounters the second }, it thinks it's closing something incorrectly, like an else clause, but there was none because the previous } closed the if block instead.

Therefore, to fix this, I need to ensure that both the if and else parts have their own braces. So the correct structure should be:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

This way, each conditional branch has its own block enclosed in curly braces.

Looking back at the original code, after the if statement's closing }, there was an else without any opening brace, and then another } which probably belonged to the else. So I need to add { around the else clause as well.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
