Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, so the structure here is if-else statement. Typically, each condition in an if-else block should have its own set of statements enclosed within curly braces {}.

Looking at the code, I see that after the if statement's condition, there's a square bracket [ which probably started a block, but it seems incorrect because the closing ] is not matching properly.

In the original code, after (x > 0), there's a [ and then a =1; followed by another ]. Then an else clause with b=2; and a final ].

So, I think the issue is that the square brackets are being used instead of curly braces. The code might be mistakenly using [ and ] where {} should be used for block delimiters in languages like C or Java. However, since this seems to be a different syntax (as mentioned in the note), perhaps it's allowed here.

Wait, but if I change the square brackets back to curly braces, will that fix the error? Let me try:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

Yes, that makes more sense. The else statement is correctly followed by its own block without any trailing ].

So, the main mistake was using [ and ] instead of curly braces. Replacing them should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
