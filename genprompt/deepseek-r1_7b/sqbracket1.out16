Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing an error. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause in an if statement that's already closed. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Wait, I see square brackets here which aren't part of standard syntax for if statements in most programming languages like JavaScript or Python. Oh right, maybe it's using JavaScript because of the semicolon after a=1.

In JavaScript, the if statement doesn't use square brackets. So those brackets are probably causing an issue. Let me break down the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So, it's trying to have two separate assignments inside the if and else blocks but using square brackets which isn't valid.

I remember that in JavaScript, each block after an if statement is just a semicolon-separated set of statements. So instead of square brackets around 'a=1', I should remove those entirely.

Also, looking at the error message, there's an unexpected ']'. That means somewhere a bracket was closed too early or not properly opened. In this case, the closing ] after the else clause is probably from the square brackets used incorrectly.

So to fix it, I'll remove the square brackets around 'a=1' and also remove the trailing ] at the end of the line. The correct code should have each condition with its block on separate lines or same line without extra brackets.

Putting it all together, the fixed code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else b = 2;
```
