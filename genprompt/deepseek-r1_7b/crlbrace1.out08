Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's causing an error. The user mentioned it's an unexpected '}' after the else clause in an if statement. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, let me read that again. So the structure is: if condition then block and else part.

Wait, I see the syntax error here. After the else statement, there's another closing brace '}'. That must be wrong because in an if-else statement, each clause should have its own braces for blocks.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first block, which is {a=1;}, then comes the else part. But here, the else isn't using curly braces around 'b=2'. So the code as written would be trying to close the if statement with another brace before the else ends.

Wait, no, actually, in most programming languages, the else doesn't require a block of its own unless you have multiple statements. Here, the user wrote:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

So after the first block, they added } and then wrote 'else b=2;' but didn't close with another brace.

Wait no, looking again: The code is if (...) { a = 1; }, followed by an else statement without braces. So when written as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

The correct way would be to either have the else inside its own block or close it properly.

But in their code, they wrote two closing braces: after the first if's block, then another } before 'else...'

Wait no, looking again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So the structure is:

- if condition checked
- then {
- statement;
}
then else statement followed by;

But the code has two closing braces. Let me count: The first part is "if (...) { a=1; }" which ends with }. Then after that, the next line starts with 'else b=2;' and then another ';}' at the end.

So in total, there are three closing braces? Wait no:

Wait, let's parse it step by step.

The code as written is:

Line 1: if (x >0) { a =1; }

Then Line 2: } else b=2;

Then Line3: }

Wait no. Actually, the user wrote:

if (x>0) {a=1;}} else b=2;}

So perhaps in their code, it's written as two closing braces after if, then 'else...'.

No, let me check again. The user provided the code as:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Wait no, looking at the code they pasted: it's written with an extra closing brace.

So actually, in their code, after 'else' there is another '}', which isn't needed because each block should be properly closed.

So the correct structure should have:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

Or alternatively, if you don't want the else to have its own block, but in this case, since it's just 'b=2;', you can write it as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

But then, when written without braces for else part, it might not cause a problem because else is just one statement. However, the error message says there's an unexpected brace after else.

So perhaps the code in their case has two closing braces after the if block and before else, which causes the parser to think that another } is needed somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe they intended to have both blocks closed with braces but made a mistake.

Wait, looking at their code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

They have an extra '}' after else. So the structure is:

- if condition: opening brace
- statement inside
- closing brace }
- else
- statement b=2;
- and then another '}' which isn't needed because else doesn't require a block unless you have multiple statements.

Wait, but actually, in many languages like JavaScript or Java, each block must be properly closed. So if the else is followed by two semicolons with an extra brace, that's invalid syntax.

So the correct way would be to remove the trailing brace after 'else'.

Let me rewrite it:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

But wait, does this have any braces? Yes, only around the if part. The else doesn't need one because there's only one statement.

So in that case, the code would be correct.

Alternatively, to make both parts have their own blocks:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

But perhaps the user intended just a single line for else.

In any case, the problem is an extra closing brace after 'else'. So I need to remove that.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Alternatively, if they wanted both blocks with braces, but perhaps in their original code it's not necessary. But according to the error message, there's an extra brace after else, so removing that.

So I'll adjust the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there's an extra closing brace after the `else` statement. Removing this erroneous brace will fix the syntax issue.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, if you intended to have braces around both statements:

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```
