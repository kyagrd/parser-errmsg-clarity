Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So I need to look at the code and see where the problem is.

Looking at the code provided:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice that there are some strange symbols here—specifically, '《' and '》'. These look like they might be special characters used for something. Maybe they're angle brackets or something similar.

The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So I think the code is trying to close a block but it's using the wrong symbol. In Python, we use parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces as part of syntax, so maybe these 《 and 》 are intended for something else.

Let me compare them with standard bracket characters:
- '()[]{}' are the usual ones.
- Maybe '《》' are like full-width versions or used in some specific contexts.

In this case, the code is inside an if statement. The original code has:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after the if condition, there's '《 a = 1; 》'. That looks like they're trying to close some block, perhaps a comment or something else. But then after the else clause, there's another '》', which is causing an error.

I think the issue is that the code is using these brackets in a way that Python doesn't recognize as part of any valid syntax structure. So maybe those 《 and 》 are not needed here at all.

Looking closer, perhaps the user meant to use parentheses for grouping or comments. Alternatively, they might have used them by mistake instead of regular brackets.

Let me try to rewrite the code without these characters. If I remove the 《 and 》 around 'a =1;', it becomes:
if (x >0) a=1; else b=2;

Wait, but in Python, inside an if-else statement, you can have multiple statements on each branch. So maybe the user intended to write something like:

if x>0: a=1
else: b=2

So replacing 《 and } with nothing or proper syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps they were using {} for a dictionary but that's not clear here.

Another approach is to check if these brackets are part of an annotation. But looking at the code, it seems more like a simple assignment inside conditions.

Therefore, the correct fix would be to remove those 《 and } symbols as they are causing syntax errors. The corrected code should have regular parentheses without any extra brackets.
...done thinking.

The error occurred because unexpected '》' was used after else clause which is not part of if statement closing in Python. Removing them fixes the issue.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
