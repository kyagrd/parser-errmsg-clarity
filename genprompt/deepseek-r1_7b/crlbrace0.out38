Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error," which usually means something's wrong with the structure of the code.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that the if statement is followed by an else, but in the code, it seems like there are two blocks after the else. Wait, actually, looking closer, I see that the else has only one statement: "b = 2;" But then there's a closing brace that doesn't match properly.

In the original code, after the else, there's just "b=2; }" but it looks like the closing brace is misplaced. Let me break it down:

The if block starts with { and ends correctly on the same line: a = 1;

Then comes an else followed by b = 2; }, which probably means that the else clause isn't properly closed or there's another issue.

Wait, perhaps the code was meant to have both the if and else blocks. So after the if statement, we should have an else block as well. That makes sense because in programming, you need a corresponding opening and closing brace for each condition.

So, the original code likely intended to have two cases: when x is greater than 0, set a=1; else, set b=2;. But in the code, after "else", it just has "b = 2;" followed by } without matching the opening {.

Looking at the braces:

The if block is correctly closed with }, which matches the opening {. Then, the else statement starts but doesn't have its own opening brace. Instead, it's directly followed by b=2; and then another }, which probably belongs to the if statement again, causing a syntax error because there's no matching open for that.

So to fix this, I need to properly structure the code so that each block is correctly enclosed within braces. Let me rewrite it:

The corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, both the if and else statements have their own opening and closing braces, which fixes the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
