Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first, I notice that there are these symbols 《 and 》 which seem like they might be trying to represent curly braces {} because in markdown or some contexts, those symbols are used for emphasis. So maybe the code was written with them but should use curly braces instead.

Looking at the structure, it's an if-else statement. The syntax is almost correct except for the missing braces. Let me see:

The original code has "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》"

So after the condition, it opens with 《 and then inside, there's an assignment a=1;. Then outside that, it closes with 》. Then there's another statement for else: b=2; and also closed with 》.

Wait, this seems off because in Python (or any language), each if-else block should be within the braces of the if statement. So I think the code is trying to write:

if x >0:
    a =1
else:
    b=2

But instead of using proper indentation and colons, it's using these 《 and 》 which are being parsed as part of some markup.

So replacing those with curly braces should fix the syntax. So changing 《 to { and 》 to }, making sure that each block is properly enclosed.

Also, looking at the else statement, after the 》 closing brace for the if block, there's another statement outside which doesn't make sense. The original code ends with } after else, which would cause a syntax error because it's trying to close the else block improperly.

So I need to adjust the braces so that each condition has its own block correctly closed.

Putting it all together, replacing 《 and 》 with { and }, and ensuring proper indentation.
...done thinking.

The code had mismatched curly braces. The opening brace for the if statement wasn't properly closed before the else clause began, leading to a syntax error. Additionally, using 《 and 》 instead of { and } caused formatting issues.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

The fixed code is:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
