Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here: 

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And it's giving me a syntax error. Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong.

First, I notice that there are some strange characters at the beginning and end of the lines. There's an @ symbol after if (x > 0), and then another # before else b = 2; Then there are these triple backticks around the code, but that might just be formatting for me to see it better.

I remember in programming, when you have a syntax error, sometimes it's because of incorrect operators or missing punctuation. Let me look at each part step by step.

The first line is if (x > 0) @ a = 1;. The @ symbol doesn't ring a bell as something I should be using here. Maybe that's the problem. Perhaps in this context, it shouldn't be there? Or maybe it's supposed to represent an operator or keyword?

Wait, maybe the @ was meant to be something else, like an assignment operator. But normally, you don't use @ for assignments; that's more for things like pointers in C or other languages.

Looking at the second line: # else b = 2;. The '#' symbols are usually used for comments in some languages, but here they might not be necessary and could be causing issues. Also, after the else statement, there should probably be an operator to assign a value, so maybe that's another issue.

Putting it all together, perhaps the code is trying to use something like an if-else block with assignments inside each condition. Maybe the @ was supposed to be an assignment operator (like =) but placed incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the # symbols are causing syntax issues because they're not part of a comment in this context.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's using C-like syntax? But I'm not sure about that because the code uses semicolons at the end of each line. In C, you can have multiple statements on one line separated by semicolons, but maybe something else is wrong here.

Let me try to rewrite this without the @ and # symbols:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Does that make sense? So removing the @ and # gives us an if-else statement where each condition assigns a value. That seems more logical because in an if-else block, you assign different values based on the condition.

Also, I should check for missing semicolons or colons. But looking at this rewritten code, it ends each line with a semicolon, which is correct.

So maybe the original issue was that the @ and # were misplaced or unnecessary. Removing them fixes the syntax because it forms valid statements without any extraneous characters causing confusion.
...done thinking.

The fixed code removes the `@` and `#` symbols to form proper if-else statements with assignments.

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
