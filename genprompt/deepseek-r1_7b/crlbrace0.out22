Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message is "syntax error," so there's something wrong with the structure or statements in the code. Let me take a look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, okay, so I notice that the if statement is correctly written: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`. But then there's an else block without an if condition. Wait, no, actually, it's just `else b = 2;` without any preceding if statement.

In programming, every else must be tied to an if or another conditional statement. Here, the else is attached directly after the if, which isn't correct because there's nothing for it to else to. That's probably why we're getting a syntax error.

So, I need to check if this code was intended to have only one condition. If that's the case, then maybe just removing the else part would fix it. Alternatively, perhaps the intention was to write an if-else block with both conditions present.

Looking at the current structure: after the opening curly brace of the if statement, there's a semicolon and `a = 1;`, which seems off because you don't need a semicolon there unless it's part of a larger expression. Wait, actually, in C-like languages, you typically write assignments without semicolons right after the condition block.

But more importantly, the else statement is causing an error because there's no corresponding if for it to pair with. So perhaps the code was meant to be either:

Option 1: If only one branch is needed.
Change `else b = 2;` into just `b = 2;`.

Option 2: Intentionally write both conditions but might have missed a closing brace or something.

Wait, looking again at the code after fixing the else part: The original code ends with an extra } which isn't necessary if there's only one condition. So perhaps that's also causing confusion.

So, step by step:

1. Identify where the syntax error is. Here, it's between the else statement and its lack of corresponding if.
2. Remove the else block so that the code becomes just `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`.
3. Alternatively, if we intended to have an else for when x <= 0, then we need to add another condition inside the else clause.

But considering the minimal fix as per the error message and without adding more conditions unless necessary, removing the else block might be sufficient to eliminate the syntax error.

So, I'll remove the `else` statement and its corresponding code. The fixed code should now only have the if block.
...done thinking.

The original code had an improper use of the `else` keyword without a corresponding `if`. To fix this, we simply removed the `else` clause as it wasn't needed.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
```
