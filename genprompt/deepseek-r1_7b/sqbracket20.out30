Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

First, looking at the error message it says "syntax error," which usually means something's wrong with how the code is structured.

I notice that inside the if statement, there's an array bracket `[` and later another `]`. In many programming languages like C or JavaScript, square brackets are used for arrays. But in this context, where they're placed after the condition in an if-else statement, that doesn't make much sense.

The code is written as `(x > 0)[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So after the if condition, there's `[`, then some code inside which assigns `a=1`, then another `]` before the else part. That seems off because in an if-else structure, you shouldn't have brackets around statements unless it's a control structure like switch-case or something that takes an expression.

Wait, maybe they meant to use an array initializer? Because sometimes people put expressions inside square brackets when initializing arrays dynamically. For example, `[0, 1]` is an empty array with two elements. But in this case, the code is `a = 1;`, which seems more like an assignment statement.

Alternatively, maybe they intended to have a ternary operator or some kind of conditional expression. But I'm not sure if that's what's needed here.

Another thought: The else part ends with `else b = 2; ]`. There are two closing brackets at the end, which might be causing an issue because each bracket should only close once. So perhaps there's an extra closing bracket somewhere.

Looking closer, after the if condition and its block, they have `[ a = 1; ] else ...` but then another `]` at the end. Wait, maybe that's not right. The structure should be:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in this code, it's written as `(x > 0)[a=1;] else b=2;]`, which is incorrect because the square brackets are misplaced.

So perhaps they meant to use curly braces `{}` for the if and else blocks. That would make sense syntactically because square brackets aren't typically used in that context unless it's an array or a specific language construct.

Let me try replacing `[` with `{` and `}` instead:

```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;}
else     {b = 2;}
```

Wait, but the original code has only one semicolon after each block. So maybe they intended to have an if-else statement where each condition is a separate block.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and they meant to write:

if (x >0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

Which would fix the syntax error by using braces instead of square brackets.

So in that case, replacing the `[` with `{` and `}` after both if and else should fix it. Also, I need to make sure each statement is properly indented or at least on its own line without trailing commas or syntax issues.

Wait, but looking back, maybe the code was trying to assign a value conditionally using a ternary operator? So perhaps the correct way would be:

a = (x >0) ? 1 : 2;

But that's speculative since the original code uses if-else structure with square brackets. Alternatively, they might have intended array initializers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant to write `{` instead of `[`, so let me try changing them all:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense. So the square brackets were incorrect; using braces should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;}
else     {b = 2;}
```

The original code had mismatched and misplaced square brackets. By replacing them with curly braces `{}`, we fix the syntax, as braces are used for block structures in if-else statements.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The error was caused by using square brackets `[` and `]` outside of an array context.
2. In control structures like if-else, square brackets should be replaced with curly braces `{}` to denote code blocks.
3. Replacing the brackets fixes the syntax error while maintaining the intended logic.

Corrected Code:
```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;}
else     {b = 2;}
```
