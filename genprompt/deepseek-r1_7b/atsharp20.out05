Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error, and they want me to use only the information from the error message without relying on my prior knowledge of other programming languages.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
I notice a few things. First, there are two lines here: an if condition and an else statement. But in most programming languages like C or Python, each conditional block must be properly indented or structured.

The code uses `@` before the assignment operator `=` which is unusual. I'm not sure where that comes from. Maybe it's a typo for a different symbol, perhaps `->` if we're talking about C++. But in the context of an if statement, I don't think `@` is valid.

Also, there are two semicolons on separate lines: `; # else b = 2;`. That might be causing issues. In many languages, each statement ends with a semicolon, but here it seems like they're spread out incorrectly.

Putting this together, the main issue seems to be improper syntax for an if-else block. The code isn't correctly structured because of the missing braces `{}` around the block and the incorrect use of `@`.

So, I think adding curly braces `{}` after the else statement would fix it. That way, the code knows which statements belong together.

The corrected code should look like this:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
Or perhaps even better with proper spacing and combining the two lines without the comments.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
