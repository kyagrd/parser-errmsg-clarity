Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let's see what the problem is.

The user provided a code snippet with an error message: "syntax error". The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Looking at this, I notice that it's using square brackets `[]` where they aren't typically used in programming. In most languages like Python or Java, square brackets are for arrays or lists, not conditionals.

The code seems to be trying to write an if-else statement but is using `[ ]` instead of parentheses. The original structure uses `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`, which probably isn't valid syntax for the intended language.

I recall that in some contexts, like certain scripting languages or specific frameworks, people use square brackets for conditional expressions, but it's not standard. The error message suggests a syntax issue because of the mismatched brackets and incorrect structure.

The correct approach would be to replace the square brackets with parentheses `()` since they're already used correctly in the conditionals. Additionally, there are extra closing braces at the end which don't have corresponding opening braces, causing an imbalance. So I should remove those extra braces.

So, correcting it step by step:
1. Change `[ ]` after the if condition to `( )`.
2. Remove the trailing `]` that's not matched.
3. Ensure the else block is properly enclosed within parentheses and has its own closing brace.

The corrected code should look like:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

This way, each condition is properly structured with opening and closing braces, and the if-else statement is correctly formatted.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
