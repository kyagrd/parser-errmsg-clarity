Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. The user provided an error message and some code that has issues. So, first, I need to understand what's wrong with the code based on the error message.

Looking at the error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)." Hmm, so it seems like there are these symbols 《 and 》 used somewhere in the code, which are not standard in Python. In Python, we use parentheses for conditionals, brackets for lists or dicts, colons for statements, etc.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I can see that after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there are these 《 and 》 symbols. Then, in the else clause, it ends with another 》.

So, probably, the person intended to use parentheses but used 《 and 》 instead. Let me think about how this code should look. The correct structure would have each if-else block properly enclosed with parentheses or brackets where necessary.

Breaking it down:
1. The first part is `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》`
   - Here, after the condition's closing parenthesis, they're using 《 before a=1 and 》 after.
2. Then the else clause: `else b = 2; 》`

So, it seems like each line inside if and else should be within their respective parentheses or brackets.

Wait, in Python, indentation is crucial. So, maybe the code was meant to have each statement properly indented under the conditionals.

Putting it all together, I think they might have meant:
- If x > 0: set a =1
- Else: set b=2

So, correcting the syntax by replacing 《 with ( and 》 with ). Also, ensuring proper indentation for the else clause.

Let me reconstruct the code step by step:

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

First, change 《 to ( after if condition:
```
if (x > 0) (
    a = 1;
)
else b = 2;
```
But wait, the original code had semicolons. So maybe each line is a separate statement.

Alternatively, perhaps they intended single-line statements inside the conditionals, so without newlines but proper indentation.

Wait, in Python, within an if-else block, you can have multiple lines with proper indentation. But for single-line statements, it's okay to write on the same line with semicolons.

So, maybe the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

But looking at the original structure, perhaps they had all in one line except for proper parentheses. So, another way could be to enclose each statement within its own parentheses.

Wait, but that might not be necessary unless it's a complex expression. Since a=1 and b=2 are simple assignments, maybe just replace 《 with ( and 》 with ).

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) (a = 1; else b = 2; )

But wait, that doesn't make sense because if is followed by an opening parenthesis, then inside should have indented lines or correctly structured.

Alternatively, maybe each line inside if and else has its own parentheses. Let me try:

if (
    (x > 0) 
    and a =1;
else
    b=2;
)

But that might be complicating things unnecessarily.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have separate blocks for if and else with proper indentation.

Let's structure it properly:

if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

So, in terms of code without newlines but using semicolons where necessary, it would be:

if (x>0):a=1; else:b=2;

But the original had lines after the if and else. So maybe each line was intended to be on its own.

Alternatively, perhaps they wanted parentheses around each condition's block.

Wait, another thought: The original code has an extra closing parenthesis or bracket? Let me check:

The user's code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

So after the if statement's condition closes with ), they put 《, then a=1;, then 》. Then after else clause, another 》.

But in Python, each block inside an if-else should have its own parentheses or brackets unless using single-line statements.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is:

if (x >0):
    a =1;
elif something:
    b=2
else:
    c=3

But since there's only else here, it would be:

if condition:
    statement1
else:
    statement2

So applying that to the original code, which has just if and else without elif.

Thus, putting it all together, I think the correct code is replacing 《 with ( and 》 with ), ensuring proper indentation or structure within the lines.

Wait, but in the user's code, after else b=2; there's another 》. So perhaps they meant to close an extra block. Alternatively, maybe the entire if statement was supposed to be enclosed in a single parenthesis, which is not correct because it's followed by other statements.

Alternatively, maybe the original code was intended to have each line inside parentheses or brackets but was incorrectly using 《 and 》.

In any case, replacing those symbols with proper parentheses should fix the syntax error. So, let me try that.
...done thinking.

The error occurs due to incorrect use of custom characters (《 and 》) which are not recognized in Python syntax. These should be replaced with standard parentheses or brackets as appropriate for each conditional block.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

Alternatively, if using semicolons within the same line:

```python
if (x>0):a=1; else:b=2;
```

Either way, replacing 《 and 》 with parentheses or appropriate brackets corrects the syntax error.

The final code to be output is:
```python
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
becomes:

```python
if (x>0):a=1; else:b=2;
```
