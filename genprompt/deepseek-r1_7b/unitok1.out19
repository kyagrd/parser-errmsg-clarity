Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me take a look at the problem.

The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

And the error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which means it thinks this backtick is closing too early or incorrectly.

First, I notice that in the code, both if and else clauses have these symbols: 《 and 》. Typically, angle brackets like < and > are used for HTML tags or template literals, but here they look like they're supposed to be part of some syntax, maybe comments? But it's unclear. 

Wait, looking closer, after the if statement, there's a space before the closing parenthesis: ) 《. That seems off because usually, you don't have a backtick right after a bracket without proper separation.

The code structure is:

if (x > 0) 《 ... ; 》 else b = 2; 》

I think the problem is that there are extra angle brackets that aren't necessary here. The user probably intended to use comments or something, but it's causing syntax issues.

So, maybe those 《 and 》 should be removed because they don't serve a purpose in this context. Also, the space after the if condition and before the closing parenthesis is unnecessary and might be causing formatting issues.

If I remove the extra angle brackets and adjust the spacing, the code becomes:

if (x > 0)   a = 1; else b = 2;

That makes more sense because each clause has its own statement without any extra backticks. The error was due to those extra characters that were causing the interpreter or compiler to think there's an unexpected closing bracket.

I should also check if removing these affects the code's functionality. Since they're just placeholders, their removal shouldn't change how the code runs, but it will fix the syntax error.

So, the corrected code is as above.
...done thinking.

The original code has extra angle brackets (`《` and `》`) that are causing a syntax error. These unnecessary characters should be removed to fix the issue.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**
1. **Identify Extra Characters:** Notice the presence of `《` and `》` after the if statement and else clause.
2. **Remove Nonsense Characters:** Eliminate these extra angle brackets as they are not part of standard syntax.
3. **Adjust Formatting:** Ensure proper spacing without any leading/trailing spaces to enhance readability.

Here is the corrected code:

```plaintext
if (x > 0)   a = 1; else b = 2;
```
