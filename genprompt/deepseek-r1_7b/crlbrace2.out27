Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this code based on the error message provided. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means the code has a syntax error related to braces.

Looking at the original code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that it starts with an if statement, then an else clause. The structure seems like this: if condition, then some statements, followed by else and another statement. But in JavaScript, for example, each block should be enclosed within curly braces.

In the given code, after the if statement's closing brace '}', there's an else statement without any braces. That would cause a syntax error because the else is expecting its own block of code. So, I think adding braces around the else clause and its body would fix it.

So, I'll add opening and closing braces for the else part:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but in the original code, after the if statement's }, there was an else followed by b=2; and then another }. So maybe it's intended to have only one line inside each block. But adding braces might be necessary for correct syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is meant to have both a and b assigned within their respective blocks without braces because they're single lines. But given the error about an unexpected '}', I think adding braces around the else part would resolve it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
