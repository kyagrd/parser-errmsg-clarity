Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code provided: 

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

First, I notice that the user mentioned using only the error message and not any pre-trained knowledge. So I should focus solely on the syntax error mentioned.

Looking at the code structure, there's an `if` statement with an `else`. The problem is probably in how they're writing the conditional expressions.

In C/C++, conditions can be written as single-line statements without needing semicolons after brackets if it's a single expression. For example, `(x > 0) ? (a =1) : b=2;`

Wait, but looking at the code again: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Hmm, I think the issue is that in C/C++, when using square brackets for array accesses or as part of an expression, they don't need semicolons. So maybe the user tried to write it like `if (x>0)[...]` but missed the ternary operator syntax.

So perhaps the correct way is to use the ternary operator `(condition) ? expression1 : expression2;`. Also, I should check for missing braces or brackets and proper indentation.

Wait, in the code provided, after the `else`, there's a semicolon before closing the bracket. Maybe that's causing an issue because it's adding an unnecessary semicolon at the end of the if statement.

Putting this together, the correct syntax would be to remove the square brackets around the expressions and use the ternary operator correctly.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to incorrect use of conditional expressions in C/C++. The corrected version uses the ternary operator with proper structure.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue:** The original code uses `[ ]` instead of parentheses for conditionals, which is not valid syntax.
2. **Correct Structure:** Replace square brackets with parentheses and use the ternary operator `?:`.
3. **Remove Redundant Semicolons:** Remove semicolons after brackets to adhere to C/C++ syntax rules.

**Fixed Code:**
```
if ((x > 0) ? (a = 1) : b = 2);
```
