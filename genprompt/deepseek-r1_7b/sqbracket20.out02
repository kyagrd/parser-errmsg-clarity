Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet: 

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The user says there's a syntax error. Hmm. So first, I notice that in the if statement, they're using square brackets instead of parentheses or braces. In many programming languages like C or JavaScript, square brackets aren't used for conditionals. They usually use parentheses.

Wait, but looking closer, the code starts with "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". So after the if condition, they have [a=1;], and then an else statement followed by another ]. The extra ] at the end might be causing the syntax error because it's closing a block that wasn't opened properly.

In languages like C or JavaScript, you can use square brackets for arrays or objects, but here it seems to be part of a conditional. So maybe replacing [ with ( would fix it?

Let me try rewriting the code: if ((x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}). Wait, no, that's using braces, which is more common in languages like C++. But since they used square brackets before, perhaps keeping it simple without braces might be better.

Alternatively, maybe just removing the square brackets and parentheses. So changing to if (x >0) a=1; else b=2;. That way, each condition has its assignment statement properly enclosed.

Yes, I think that's correct because in an if-else structure, you can have multiple statements but they need proper block delimiters. Using the same type of brackets consistently would make sense here.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by mismatched square brackets and incorrect syntax for the conditional statement. The code should use parentheses instead of square brackets and properly enclose each condition's assignment.

Here's the fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```
