Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see that right after the if statement, there are some characters: 《 and 》. These symbols don't look like standard programming syntax to me. I remember in HTML, 《 is used for left-pointing brackets, but here it's probably not intended.

The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So maybe those brackets are causing a problem because they aren't recognized as part of the code structure.

Looking at the if statement: if (x > 0) ... then inside, there's a = 1; followed by 》. That must be closing something incorrectly, perhaps a comment or another block that isn't closed properly.

The next line is else b = 2; followed by another 》. This seems like an extra closing bracket that doesn't belong here.

So the issue is that there are extra 《 and 》 characters after the if statement and else clause which aren't part of any valid syntax in this context. They might have been mistakenly added instead of proper braces or something else.

To fix this, I should remove those unexpected brackets. Let me see:

The corrected code would be without the 《 and 》 after 'if' and 'else'. So it should look like a standard if-else statement with semicolons separating each line inside.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0)  a = 1; else b = 2;

That way, there are no extra characters causing syntax errors. The brackets were probably leftover from somewhere else or incorrectly added.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)  a = 1; else b = 2;
```
