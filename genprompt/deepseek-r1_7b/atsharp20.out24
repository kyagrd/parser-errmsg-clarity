Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax issue. Let me take a look at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, right off the bat, I notice some odd characters in there: @ and # symbols after the if statement. In most programming languages like C or Java, those aren't valid keywords or operators. So probably this isn't standard syntax.

The code seems to be trying to handle an if-else condition where if x is greater than 0, set a to 1; otherwise, set b to 2. But the way it's written now has these @ and # which don't make sense in that context.

I remember from previous knowledge (but I'm not using that here) that maybe this was supposed to be C code or something similar where you can use labels with #, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is trying to mix up different syntax structures.

Wait, looking at the if statement: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;". The @ doesn't fit anywhere in an if condition. Maybe it's supposed to be something else, like an assignment operator? But = is used for assignments elsewhere, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps they meant to write a label using # but that's more common in C-like languages.

Alternatively, maybe the code was trying to use ternary operator syntax. In Python, you can write it as (x>0) and 1 or 2, which is equivalent to if-else. But here, the user is mixing up different structures.

Wait, but looking back at the error message: "syntax error". So it's a basic syntax issue in whatever language this code is written. The @ symbol isn't valid after an if statement in most languages, and # could be part of a comment or something else entirely.

So perhaps the intention was to use a ternary operator instead. Let me think about how that works. In Python, it's (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false, but in many languages like JavaScript or Ruby, it's similar without the space: condition ? true_val : false_val.

Alternatively, maybe this is intended for C-like code where you can have labels with #, but I'm not sure. However, given the presence of @ and #, perhaps the correct approach is to replace those with nothing because in ternary operators or switch statements, these symbols don't belong.

So if we take out the @ and #, the code becomes:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Wait, but that's not valid syntax either. In C-like languages, you can have compound conditions with braces, but here it's just an if statement without curly braces. Maybe the user intended to write something like assigning based on the condition using an if-else block.

But perhaps a better approach is to convert this into a ternary operator since that would fix the syntax error by eliminating the @ and # and combining the two statements into one line, which is valid in many languages including Python, JavaScript, etc.

So rewriting it as (x > 0) ? 1 : 2; might be more concise. However, if this code is meant to run in a specific language where multi-line conditionals are allowed without braces, then perhaps the correct way is to adjust the syntax accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe using an else clause correctly with semicolons and proper formatting.

Wait, looking at the original code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

So the user probably meant to write something like:

if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;

But with proper indentation and syntax. But in this case, without braces or using C-style if-else.

Wait, but without braces, it's written as two separate statements after the if and else clauses. So perhaps the user intended to write:

if (x > 0)
a = 1;
else
b = 2;

But that would be valid in some languages where you can have multi-line conditionals with proper indentation or using {}. Alternatively, maybe using a single line for each case.

So considering all this, I think the correct fix is to remove the @ and # symbols because they're invalid here. Then, properly structure the if-else statement.

But looking at it again, perhaps the code was written in Python where multi-line conditionals are allowed without braces but require proper indentation or using {}.

Alternatively, perhaps the user was trying to write a ternary operator which is more concise and fixes the syntax error.

So considering all possibilities, I think replacing @ with nothing, removing # and adjusting for correct syntax would fix it. So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But wait, in languages like C or Java, you can't have statements directly after if without proper structure. So maybe wrapping them in braces.

So perhaps:

if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;

That would be the correct way, but with appropriate indentation.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax issues due to invalid symbols `@` and `#`. Removing these and correctly structuring the if-else statement fixes the error.

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Alternatively, for better readability with proper formatting:

```fix
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
```
