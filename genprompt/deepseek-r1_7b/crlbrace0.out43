Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code and the error message. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

And the error message says there's a syntax error. Hmm, where could the issue be?

First, I notice that in an if-else statement in JavaScript, both branches must have complete statements. That means each branch needs to end with a semicolon and can't leave any expressions hanging unless they're part of a single statement.

Looking at the code, after the if condition, there's { a = 1; }, which is correct because it ends with a semicolon. But then, in the else block, it just says b = 2;. Wait, that doesn't end with a semicolon. That might be causing the syntax error.

So I think the problem is that the else statement is incomplete. It should have braces to enclose the code block. Also, maybe there's an extra closing brace at the end which isn't needed.

Let me rewrite it properly. The if-else structure should look like this:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes, that makes sense. Both branches now have their own blocks with semicolons, and the extra closing brace at the end is removed.

I think that's it. The fixed code should resolve the syntax error because each statement within the if-else condition is properly enclosed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
