Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet with a syntax error. The user mentioned that the code is written in a language different from C, Java, or Python. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, first off, I see an if statement with some operators and variables. The error message just says "syntax error," so something's wrong with how it's written.

The line starts with `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`. Wait, in many programming languages like C or JavaScript, the ternary operator is `?:`, not `@`. So using `@` here is probably incorrect. Maybe that's why there's a syntax error.

Looking at how the ternary operator works: it should be something like `(condition) ? (truePart) : (falsePart);`. So in this case, the user might have intended to use the ternary operator but used `@` instead of `:` and `?`.

Also, after the if statement, there's a comment starting with `#`, which is probably meant for a single-line comment. But comments in some languages are denoted by `//` or `/* */`. In C-like languages, it's `//`, but here since we're using a ternary operator, maybe they're using a different syntax where the comment isn't properly placed.

Wait, looking at the code again: after the if statement, there's another line starting with `else b = 2;` and then a comment. So perhaps the user intended to write something like `(x > 0) ? (a =1) : (b=2);` but instead wrote it with `@` which isn't valid.

So putting this together, replacing `@` with `?:`, fixing the syntax, and moving the else part under the ternary operator. Also, removing the comment since it's not correctly placed or unnecessary after correcting the code.

So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;

But wait, in some languages, you can't assign inside an expression like that unless using side effects. If this is intended to be a ternary operator assigning different values based on the condition, then maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each branch should have its own statement, but without knowing the exact language, I'll proceed with replacing `@` with `?:`.

Also, removing the # comments as they might not be necessary or misplaced.

So the fixed code is:

if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;

That should fix the syntax error by using the correct ternary operator.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```
