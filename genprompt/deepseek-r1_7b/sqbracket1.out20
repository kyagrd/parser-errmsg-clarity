Thinking...
Alright, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code they provided to understand what's wrong.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Okay, breaking this down. The structure starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then inside the parentheses, there's just a condition without any braces or brackets. Wait, no, actually, they have `[ a = 1; ]` right after the parenthesis.

So it looks like they're trying to write some code inside the if block but using square brackets instead of curly braces. In JavaScript, for example, you'd use curly braces `{}` for block scope, not square brackets.

Then, outside the if block, there's an else clause: `else b = 2; ]`. But here, they have a closing square bracket `]` after the else statement, which doesn't make sense because in JavaScript, the else keyword is followed by code indented inside curly braces. So having a `]` at the end of the else line would be incorrect.

Looking at the error message: it's expecting something between the if and else clauses but found an unexpected ']'. That suggests that there's an extra or misplaced bracket somewhere. In this case, the code has `[ ]` around `a = 1;`, which is unnecessary because it's already in a block (if any). Also, the closing `]` after the else is causing the syntax error.

So to fix this, I should probably remove the square brackets and use curly braces for the if statement. That way, the code inside the if and else will be properly enclosed without extra brackets. Let me rewrite it:

Change `[ a = 1; ]` to `{ a = 1; }`, and also correct the else line by removing the trailing `]`. So the corrected code would be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else b = 2;
```

This should fix the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed with curly braces, and there's no extra closing bracket causing confusion.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
