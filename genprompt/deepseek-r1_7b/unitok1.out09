Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given Python code. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Hmm, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I notice that there are these angle brackets 《 and 》 which don't look like standard Python syntax. In Python, we use parentheses (), square brackets [], or curly braces {} for grouping. The angle brackets must be a mistake.

The code has an if statement: if (x > 0) followed by some code inside. Then it has an else clause with b = 2; and ends with another 》 which is probably causing the error because there's nothing matching it after the if-else block.

So, I think the intention was to use regular parentheses for both the condition and the body of the if statement. Let me rewrite that part using normal parentheses instead of angle brackets. Also, since the else clause ends with a semicolon, maybe we should add a closing parenthesis there as well to make it correct.

Wait, looking again: after the else, it's 'b = 2;' followed by another '》'. That extra } is probably wrong and shouldn't be there. So replacing the angle brackets with regular ones and removing that extra one should fix it.
...done thinking.

The code has an unexpected `》` which suggests using regular parentheses instead of angle brackets for grouping.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The original code uses angle brackets (`《` and `》`) in places where standard parentheses are required.
2. Replace these with regular round parentheses to match Python's syntax requirements.
3. Remove the extra closing parenthesis after the else clause since it wasn't needed.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
