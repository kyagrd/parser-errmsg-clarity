Thinking...
Alright, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

And they mentioned an error message saying "syntax error." My task is to fix the syntax without using any pre-trained knowledge, just based on the error and the given code.

First, I'll examine the code line by line. The structure starts with an if statement: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me break it down. The if condition is correct: x > 0. Then there's an opening brace, followed by a semicolon and assigning a to 1. That seems fine.

Then comes the else statement. In most programming languages like JavaScript or C++, after the else keyword, you should have another block of code enclosed in braces. So it should be } else { b = 2; }

But in the given code, instead of having an opening brace after else, there's just a semicolon and then assigning b=2 without any braces. That could cause issues because the syntax might not be properly structured.

So I think the problem is with the placement of 'else' and the missing braces. The original code ends the if block correctly with }, but then starts an else statement without braces, which would result in a syntax error.

To fix this, I'll adjust the else part to include braces. So after else, there should be an opening brace, followed by the assignment inside it, and then another closing brace before the semicolon at the end of the statement.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should have proper braces for both if and else blocks. Let me rewrite that.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to incorrect placement of the `else` keyword and missing braces for the conditional statements. The fix involves adding an opening brace after `else` before assigning the value to variable `b`.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```

The corrected code properly formats the if-else structure with braces for each block, ensuring that the syntax is valid and the conditions are correctly enclosed.
