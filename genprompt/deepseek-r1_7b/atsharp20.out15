Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this syntax error problem step by step. The user provided a code snippet with a syntax error and an error message indicating a problem. My goal is to fix the code using only the information from the error message without prior knowledge of the specific language or its syntax rules.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
I notice that there are two comment-like lines starting with `#`. In many programming languages, having multiple statements separated by semicolons can cause issues if they're not intended to be on the same line. Also, the presence of `@` before a variable assignment is unusual. I recall that in some contexts, like C or similar languages, `@` isn't a valid operator.

First, I'll check for semicolon usage. The code has two separate lines ending with semicolons. If these are meant to be part of the same statement, combining them into one line might resolve the syntax error. So, I can try removing the second `# else b = 2;` line and appending it after the first part.

Next, considering the `@ a = 1;` part. If this is intended to assign a value conditionally, perhaps using a ternary operator would be appropriate here. In languages like C or JavaScript, you can use `condition ? expression : other_expression`. So replacing `@ a = 1;` with something like `(x > 0) ? 1 : ...` makes sense.

Putting it all together, I'll combine the statements into one line using proper syntax. That should fix both the comment issue and the assignment operator problem.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```
