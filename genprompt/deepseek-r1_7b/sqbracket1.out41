Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, okay, let me break it down.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I see an if-else structure here. The if condition is `(x > 0)` with some code inside, then else followed by `b = 2;` and another `]`. Wait, that's probably the issue.

The error mentions an unexpected ']' after the else clause. So, maybe there are too many brackets closing at once. Let me visualize the structure:

- The if statement starts with `[`, which is a block start.
- Inside, it has `a = 1;`.
- Then the ] closes that block.
- Next comes `else b = 2; ]`

So after else, there's another `]` closing something. But in the code, the if condition and its body are already closed with `[ ]`. So perhaps the extra `]` at the end is causing the problem.

Wait, let me check the syntax of an if statement in some programming language. Typically, it's:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

In this case, the code seems to be using semicolons instead of curly braces `{}`, but even so, each block should start and end with matching brackets.

Looking again, after `else b = 2;`, there's another `]`. That might not belong. So maybe that extra closing bracket is the problem. If I remove it, does the code make sense?

So, let me try modifying the code:

Original: `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

If I remove the last `]`, it becomes `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`.

That would close both blocks correctly. The if block with its body and then the else block without an extra bracket.

I think that's what needs to be done. So the fixed code should have only one closing bracket after each block, making sure they properly match.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
