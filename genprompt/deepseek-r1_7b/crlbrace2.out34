Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet here: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

And there's an error saying "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong.

Looking at the code, I see that the if statement starts with "if (x > 0) {", then inside the block, it has "a = 1;". Then there's an else clause: "else b = 2;". After that, there's a closing brace } and another one }, which seems off.

Wait, so the structure is:

if (...) { ... }

else ...

But in the code, after the else statement, there's another }, which probably isn't needed. So I think the error is because of an extra closing brace at the end of the if-else block.

The correct syntax should be to have one opening brace for the entire if-else condition and one closing brace for it. In this case, the code has:

if (...) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the given code, after the else statement, there's an extra }, making it three braces at the end: one after the if, another after else, and then a third. That causes the parser to think there's an unexpected }.

So I need to remove that extra closing brace. Let me rewrite the code correctly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
