Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a code snippet with an unexpected '#' after the else clause. My task is to fix the syntax error without using any pre-trained knowledge, relying solely on the error message and the given code.

First, I'll read the error message carefully: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". This suggests there's something wrong with a comment in the code that's causing an issue. The code provided is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Looking at this, I notice that after the `if` statement, there's an anonymous function or some expression because of the `@` symbol before `a = 1`. Then, right after the semicolon from the anonymous function, there's a comment starting with `# else b = 2;` and another `#` at the end.

The error is pointing out that there's an unexpected '#' following the else clause. Since comments in many languages are denoted by `#`, placing it here might be causing the interpreter to think that the if statement has already closed, hence the error.

I recall that in some contexts, especially when using certain syntax like lambda functions or inline code, you can't have a comment immediately after an else clause because of how parsing works. The parser might get confused and throw an error.

To fix this, I should remove the comment from where it's causing confusion. Since there are two `#` symbols in the code, one is part of the anonymous function (which isn't valid syntax), and the other is misplaced. Removing both lines containing these would eliminate the error.

So, the corrected code should not have any comments after the if statement or inside its block. Therefore, I'll remove the entire commented lines:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

This way, there are no syntax errors related to misplaced comments. The anonymous function is still present without causing any issues, and the else clause correctly follows.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
