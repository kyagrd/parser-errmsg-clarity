Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message is "syntax error," so there's something wrong with the structure of the code.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that after the if-else statement, there are two closing braces. Wait, let me check: The if block has one brace, then the else is followed by another brace and then another line with 'b=2;' and another closing brace.

So it's actually three closing braces in a row? That can't be right because each statement should end with only one brace. It looks like an extra brace was added after the else clause.

Let me count: 

- The if condition opens at {, then inside is a = 1; }, so that's two braces.
- Then the else block starts without checking, and it has its own {. That might be where the problem is. Wait no, in the code provided, after else, there's another } before b=2;. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me look again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So it's like this: if condition with one block, then else followed by another block which is just 'b=2;' and another closing brace.

Wait, actually, the structure should be:

if (...) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

But in the given code, after else b=2; there's a }, so it's treating 'else' as part of an if-else statement but only with one condition. Or perhaps it's trying to have two conditions but incorrectly formatted.

Wait, maybe the code is missing a closing brace after the else clause. Let me check:

The correct structure should be: 

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

So in this case, each condition has its own block. The given code has an extra brace at the end.

Looking back, the original code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Which means after the else statement, it's followed by a }, which might be incorrect because 'else' doesn't have its own block unless we put braces around the else part.

Wait no, in JavaScript, you can write:

if (...) { ... } else { ... }

Or without braces as shorthand. So maybe the code is intended to have two separate statements after if and else, each within their own braces.

But in the given code, it's written as:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So that would translate to:

if condition runs block: a=1;
else runs: b=2;

Wait, but in JavaScript, you can't have just 'b=2;' without braces after else. Or wait, actually, if the else body is only one statement, it doesn't need braces. But looking at the code again, the user provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that's: if condition with block ending at }, then else followed by 'b=2;' and another }. That makes two closing braces after the else, which is incorrect.

Wait no, in code, it would be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But here, there are three closing braces. Because after the if block, one }, then 'else ...' with another brace and ending.

No, let me parse line by line:

Line 1: if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
Then Line 2: } else b=2;
But in code, it's written as:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So the structure is:

if (...) { ... } else ...;

Wait, that can't be right because after the if block's }, you have 'else ...;' which starts another statement. But in JavaScript, once an if-else is written with braces, each condition must be inside their own braces.

Alternatively, perhaps it's intended to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

So that after the if block, we have an else block as well. So in this case, the code has an extra }, causing three closing braces at the end: one from the if, another from the else.

Wait no, looking again:

The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that's two statements after the initial if and else. The first statement has }, then the second starts with 'else ...' which should have its own braces unless it's shorthand.

But since in this case, both conditions (if and else) are separate statements, each requiring their own block with braces, we need to adjust the code accordingly.

So the correct code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each condition has its own brace.

Therefore, in the original code, after the if block's }, there should only be one more }, but it seems like an extra was added. So removing that and ensuring each part is within braces.

So fixing the syntax error by adding a closing brace to the else clause.
...done thinking.

The code has two consecutive closing braces, causing a syntax error. To fix this, we add a missing closing brace after the else statement so that each if-else block properly closes separately.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
