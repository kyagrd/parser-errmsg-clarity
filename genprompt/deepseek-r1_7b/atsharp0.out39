Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. The user mentioned that there's an issue and provided the code along with an error message saying "syntax error." My task is to fix the code without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's given. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code snippet is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Alright, I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or C++, we have constructs called preprocessor directives. These start with `#` and are used for including header files or making conditional definitions. So the lines starting with `#` at the end of each condition might be causing issues.

Looking at the code, it seems to be using a syntax that's mixing C-like statements with something else, maybe pseudocode intended for an algorithm but not actual valid code in any specific language I'm aware of. But considering the error is about syntax, perhaps there are misplaced characters or incorrect constructs.

I notice `@` and `#` here. In C/C++, you can't just mix code like this; each line should be a valid statement on its own. The way it's written now looks more like two separate lines with comments or something else interfering.

So, maybe the original intention was to have an if-else block in some pseudocode but instead, they've used `#` and `@` incorrectly. But since this is code that's meant to be syntactically correct, those preprocessor directives should probably not be there unless it's intentional for something else.

Wait a minute, perhaps the user was trying to use C/C++ syntax in another context where these lines are not valid. Maybe they intended each line after `#` as a separate statement but didn't format them correctly.

So, maybe the correct approach is to remove those lines that start with `#` because they're not valid statements on their own and just leave the if-else structure intact.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to have a function or something else that uses these tokens in an incorrect way. But without more context, it's hard to say.

But focusing purely on the error message: "syntax error." The most common syntax errors are missing semicolons, improper use of operators, etc. Here, looking at each statement:

- `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`
  
This line has an `@` which isn't part of any valid operator in C/C++. It should probably be removed.

Similarly, the second line:
  
- `else b = 2;`

Wait, but how does that fit into the first if statement? The syntax seems off. Also, without proper indentation or structure, it's confusing.

So putting it all together, maybe the correct approach is to remove those lines with `#` and `@`, leaving just a standard if-else block:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But perhaps in their context, they don't use braces or have different syntax. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to be one-liners without the braces.

In that case, each statement should end with a semicolon and not start on the same line as another control structure unless properly indented or within the same block.

Alternatively, perhaps using `else` directly after `if` but in correct syntax. Wait, no, else can't come right after the if condition without an opening brace or being part of the compound statement correctly structured.

Wait, looking again at their code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This is one line with some formatting. So perhaps they intended it to be two separate lines but messed up the indentation and added those `#` symbols in between.

Alternatively, maybe this was meant to represent an if-else statement without braces, so each condition should end with a semicolon on the same line as their respective statements.

Wait, no, because else is part of the if statement. So perhaps it's supposed to be:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

But in code, that would require proper structure without braces for older versions, but in modern C++, it can be done as such.

Alternatively, maybe they are trying to write pseudocode and added these `#` lines by mistake. So perhaps the correct approach is to remove those lines because they're not valid syntax.

Putting it all together, I think the main issue is that the code has two separate statements attached via the `@`, which isn't valid. Instead, each statement should be properly structured on its own line without the # symbols interfering.

So by removing those lines and keeping just the if-else part correctly formatted with proper syntax.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
