Thinking...
Alright, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me look at it again to understand what's wrong. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay, the error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So somewhere in the code, there's an extra closing bracket or brace that doesn't match properly.

Looking at the code structure, I see that it starts with an if statement: if (x > 0). Then inside the parentheses, there's a condition and then some code. After that, there's else b = 2; followed by another 》 which is closing something.

Wait, in the original code, after the else clause, there's 'else b = 2; 》'. So I think the extra '》' at the end is causing the problem because it's not properly closed. Let me check how braces are used here.

In programming languages like JavaScript or Python, if-else statements use curly braces to enclose the block of code. In the original code, after else, there's a semicolon and then another closing brace which doesn't make sense. It looks like they might have tried to close an outer block too early.

So the structure should be:

if (condition) {
    // code here;
} else {
    // code here;
}

But in the given code, it's not properly using braces. Instead, there are 《 and 》 which I think are some kind of brackets or maybe a typo for curly braces. Wait, looking closer, '《' is likely a left curly brace and '》' is a right curly brace because they might be using different encoding.

So the code should have the if statement enclosed in { }, then inside it has the else clause also enclosed in { }. But in the original code, after else b=2; there's an extra 》 which isn't needed. Also, before else, the code has 《 a =1; 》 which might be incorrect.

Let me rewrite this step by step. First, I'll make sure that each if-else statement is properly enclosed in { } to avoid any syntax errors. So:

if (x >0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

That's the correct structure with proper braces. Now, comparing it to the original code:

Original had 《 and 》 which might have been intended as if they were { } but placed incorrectly.

So in the original code: after (x>0) there was a space, then 《, then a=1;, then 》. That's like having an extra brace inside, which isn't needed because it's within the outer if block. So that part can be removed.

Then, after else b=2; there was another 》, which is closing something incorrectly. Since the entire code doesn't need to close at the end (depending on the context), but in this case, since it's an if-else statement without a closing brace for the outer block, adding an extra 》 would be wrong.

Therefore, removing the unnecessary braces and using proper { } will fix the syntax error. So the corrected code should have just one level of braces around the if-else body.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
