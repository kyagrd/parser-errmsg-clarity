Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that there are two closing braces here: one after if and another after else. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the first if statement has its own closing brace at the end of the line: if (x>0) { a=1; }. Then immediately after, outside the if block, it's } else b = 2; }. So there are two closing braces at the end.

The error message is pointing to the '}' after else. That means somewhere in between an else and another }, but here both are right after each other without any code in between. Oh, wait, no, looking again: The first if's block ends with a }, then comes else, which should be inside its own block, but it's not.

Wait, the correct structure is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in this case, after the first }, there's an else statement without braces. So that's causing the problem because the else isn't properly enclosed within braces. 

So to fix this, I should add a closing brace for the else part and make sure it's all inside its own block. So instead of having } else b=2; }, I should change it to else { b = 2; }, so that each clause has its own braces.

Wait no, actually, looking at the code again: The first line is if (x>0) { a=1; }, then immediately after, } else b=2; }. So the extra brace is causing the syntax error. 

So the corrected code should have one opening and one closing brace for each block.

Therefore, I need to make two changes:

First, the initial else doesn't have its own braces, so adding them would fix it.

But wait, perhaps the structure should be: if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

Yes, that's correct. So removing the extra closing brace after else and making sure each condition has its own block.
...done thinking.

The code had an unnecessary closing curly brace after the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure each condition within the `if-else` structure is properly enclosed with its own curly braces.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The fixed code correctly closes both branches of the conditional statements.
