Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The code is written between triple backticks, which probably means it's some kind of code snippet, maybe from a programming language like C or Java since those use similar syntax structures. Let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I notice that there are if-else statements here. In most programming languages, an if statement doesn't end with a semicolon like that because it's part of a compound structure. Wait, no, actually in C and Java, each block inside the if needs to be indented properly. But looking at this code, after the if condition, there's an @ symbol followed by a = 1;. That doesn't look right.

Wait, the user mentioned that the syntax might be different from languages like C, Python, etc. So maybe it's using some custom or pseudocode where certain symbols have specific meanings. The error message is just "syntax error," so I need to figure out what's wrong with this line.

Looking at the code again: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. It seems like there are two separate statements here, one inside the if and another in the else. But in most languages, you can't have an if statement without some kind of block structure. Oh wait, maybe it's using something else for comments or inline documentation.

Wait a second, I see `@` at the beginning of the line after the if condition. In Python, we use indentation to denote code blocks, and sometimes people add notes with @ signs, but in this case, maybe that's not intended. Alternatively, perhaps it's using some form where @ is an operator or part of a function.

But looking more carefully, I see that the code ends abruptly with `# else b = 2; #`. That doesn't look right because it's starting and ending with hash symbols, which could be comments, but in this context, they're placed inside what looks like if-else blocks. So maybe the issue is that the code isn't properly indented or structured.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that there are two separate statements here without proper scoping. In many languages, you can't have an if statement followed by else on the same line unless they're part of a compound structure. But in this case, maybe it's trying to write code that's not properly enclosed within curly braces or brackets.

Alternatively, maybe the `@` is intended for something else, like a decorator or annotation, but without knowing the exact language, it's tricky. However, since the user mentioned that the syntax might be different from C, Java, Python, etc., perhaps this code is part of a custom syntax or pseudocode where if-else statements are written differently.

Wait, looking again: The code has `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` and then `# else b = 2; #`. So the `@` might be an operator that's used in this context. Maybe it's part of an inline function or some other construct. Alternatively, perhaps the `@` is supposed to denote something like a comment within the if block.

Wait, but having two separate statements without proper control structures would cause a syntax error because each statement should have its own line or be properly indented. So maybe the issue is that the else clause isn't properly structured with braces or brackets.

But looking at the code again, I see that it's using `@` and then an assignment on the same line as if, which might not be valid syntax in this context. Perhaps each statement should be separated by a semicolon but within their own blocks.

Wait, maybe the problem is that there are two separate statements: one inside the if and another outside. But without proper braces or brackets, it's causing a syntax error because they're at the same indentation level.

Alternatively, perhaps the `@` symbol is part of an annotation or something else entirely, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the code should have curly braces around the if block to enclose all statements inside it.

So, putting this together, the main issue seems to be that there's no proper control structure enclosing the if statement and its body. In many languages, you need `{ ... }` or `()` to denote a block of code within an if-else statement. Without that, the compiler gets confused because it expects more statements inside the braces.

So, to fix this, I should add curly braces around the entire if block. Also, since the else is on the same line as part of another assignment without proper indentation or structure, adding braces might help clarify the code's intent and resolve the syntax error.

Therefore, rewriting the code with proper braces:
```
if (x > 0) { @ a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }
```

This way, each statement within the if-else block is properly enclosed, which should fix the syntax issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { @ a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
