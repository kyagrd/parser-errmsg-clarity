Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me take a look at it carefully. The code given is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, the first thing I notice is those fancy brackets, the ones with the angle symbols inside them — 《 and 》. They're used here in the if statement. But wait, how are they being used? In programming, when you have a block of code that depends on a condition, you usually use curly braces {} to enclose it. So maybe those brackets are supposed to be braces but got replaced with other symbols.

Looking at the structure, after the if (x > 0) statement, there's an opening angle bracket and then inside is 'a = 1;'. Then another closing angle bracket after the else part. That doesn't look right because in Python, for example, you'd use curly braces {} instead of these fancy brackets.

Also, looking at the syntax, the code starts with if (x > 0) followed by some lines inside and then another else statement that's supposed to have its own block but it seems like the closing bracket is misplaced or wrong. It looks like there are two closing brackets: one for each line of code, which isn't correct in Python because you can't have a single-line if-else without braces.

So I think the main issue here is that instead of using curly braces {}, the code is using 《 and 》, which aren't recognized correctly. So to fix this, I should replace those with proper curly braces.

Let me try rewriting it step by step. The original code has:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So between the if condition and the colon, there's an opening brace-like symbol, but actually in Python we need curly braces for blocks. So I'll replace those with {.

Then inside the block, it should be: a = 1;

After that, the else statement is outside of this block because it doesn't have its own block after another closing brace. Wait, no—actually, the original code has an else followed by b=2; but without braces around the else part either.

Wait, in Python, you can write:

if condition:
    do_something()
else:
    do_another()

So each if and else statement needs its own block with curly braces. In the given code, it's trying to put both inside one block incorrectly.

Looking again at the original code: after the first 《 a =1; 》 comes an else b=2;, but then another closing 》. That doesn't make sense because each if-else should have their own blocks.

So perhaps the intended structure was:

if (x >0):
    a=1
else:
    b=2

Which in code would be written with proper braces as:

if (x>0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Therefore, I should replace those fancy brackets with curly braces and ensure each condition has its own block.

So the corrected code inside the triple backquotes should be:

if (x > 0): {a = 1;}
else: {b = 2;}

Wait, but in Python you can have single-line statements inside blocks without newlines. So maybe it's better to write them on separate lines with proper indentation for clarity.

Alternatively, keeping the same formatting as close as possible to the original would be better, so replacing the brackets and ensuring each if-else block is correctly enclosed.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error in the given code, we need to replace the incorrect angle brackets (《 》) with proper curly braces ({}) for both conditional blocks.

The corrected code is:

if (x > 0): { a = 1; }
else: { b = 2; }

This ensures that each condition has its corresponding block correctly enclosed with curly braces, adhering to Python's syntax rules.
