Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Alright, I see that there's an `if` condition followed by something that looks like an arrow operator `@`, then `a=1;`, and after that, the line has a comment with `# else...` but ends with another `#`. Wait, maybe that's part of it.

So, in Ruby, you can have code inside if blocks using braces `{}`, right? So perhaps the original intention was to write something like:

```
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else
  @b = 2
end
```

But looking at the code, it's written with `@` after the `if`, which isn't correct syntax. The error message mentions an unexpected '#', so maybe there are some shebang lines or other Ruby-specific comments interfering.

Wait, in Ruby, you can have a shebang line starting with `#!/usr/bin/env`, but here I see just `# else...`. Oh, actually, the code has `@a = 1;` which is not valid inside an if statement unless it's within braces. Also, the lines are ending with `; #` which seems like they're trying to add comments after statements.

So putting this together, I think the original code was meant to be a conditional block using else clauses but got messed up with the syntax and shebang-like comments. The error is because of how the code is indented or has misplaced semicolons and comments.

To fix it, I should restructure the code into proper Ruby formatting. I'll start by writing the if statement correctly, then include the else clause within braces. Also, I need to remove any shebang-like comments since they might not be intended here or are causing syntax issues.

So rewriting:
- Indent the `else` and its block properly under the if.
- Remove the trailing semicolons after the statements inside the blocks because each line should end with a semicolon, but in Ruby, you don't need to add extra lines unless necessary.

Wait, no. Actually, each statement inside the if/else block should end with a semicolon. But in this case, since it's just variable assignments, they can stay as is without adding new lines unless desired for readability.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would have the `if` condition, then an `else`, and both blocks properly indented within braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1
else
  @b = 2
end
```
