Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code again: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. Hmm, the error message is just "syntax error", which means there's something wrong with the structure of the code.

First, I notice that after the if statement, it says [ a = 1; ]. That doesn't look right. In Python, for an if-else block, we use colons and indentation. So maybe this line is part of an if condition but isn't properly indented or structured as an actual statement.

Wait, actually, in Python, the if statement should have a colon at the end of the condition. Here, after [ a = 1; ], there's another ] which seems to close something else. But looking at this code, it looks more like pseudo-code because I see semicolons and brackets, which aren't typical for actual programming languages.

So perhaps the user is using some kind of markup or a pseudocode language. In that case, they might be trying to write an if-else structure but messed up the syntax.

Looking closer, in Python, each block inside an if statement must be indented properly. The code has [ a = 1; ] which doesn't look like valid Python because it's using square brackets and semicolons instead of colons or proper line breaks.

Maybe they intended to write something like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But the code is missing the colons and improper indentation. So perhaps in their markup, they're using square brackets where Python uses colons and indentation.

Wait, looking at the original code again: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I think the issue is that inside the if block, it's written as [a=1;], which isn't valid syntax. Maybe they meant to use an indented block but used square brackets instead.

Also, after the else statement, there's another ] which is probably closing something incorrectly.

So maybe the correct approach is to convert this into proper Python code by replacing the square brackets with indentation and colons as needed.

Wait, actually, in some languages or markup languages like JSON, you might use square brackets for arrays. But here, it seems more like they're trying to write an if-else statement using a different syntax that isn't valid.

But since I'm supposed to fix the code without knowing the specific language (except Python from the error message), perhaps I can assume that the user is writing in pseudocode or another context where square brackets aren't used for array definitions but rather for block statements.

So, considering this, maybe they intended to write:

if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

In their code, they're using [ and ] which are not correct. So I should replace those with proper indentation.

Alternatively, if the code is meant to be in another format where square brackets denote an array, but then how does that fit into an if-else structure? That seems unlikely because if-else blocks shouldn't create arrays on their own.

So perhaps they're using some kind of markup where [ and ] are used for block statements. But without knowing the exact syntax, it's tricky.

But given the error is a syntax error in Python, I think the code was meant to be Python but has incorrect syntax. So focusing on that.

In Python:

- The if statement must end with a colon.
- Each line inside the if or else block must be indented.

So looking at the original code: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]"

This is invalid because after the if condition, it's trying to add an expression without a proper colon. The [ and ; suggest they might be using some other syntax or perhaps a different language.

But since I have to fix this as Python code, let me adjust accordingly.

So replacing:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]

with

if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Yes, that makes sense. So in the fixed code, I added colons after each if and else statement and properly indented the blocks.

So putting it all together:

The original code is trying to write an if-else structure but using square brackets which are not valid Python syntax. By replacing those with proper indentation and colons, we get a valid Python if-else block.
...done thinking.

The error arises because the code incorrectly uses square brackets for defining blocks in Python. In Python, we use colons followed by indented lines for each block inside an if statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

The fixed code properly formats the if-else structure with appropriate indentation and uses proper Python syntax.
