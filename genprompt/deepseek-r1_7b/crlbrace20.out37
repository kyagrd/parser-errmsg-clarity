Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error and provided the code along with an error message. Let me look at the code carefully.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

First, I notice that this looks like it's written in some kind of programming language because there are conditional statements. The structure seems similar to C or Java since they use indentation for blocks and have if-else constructs.

Now, looking at the syntax. The error message is just "syntax error," which means something is wrong with how the code is structured. Let me break it down line by line.

The first line is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

Wait, so after the else statement, there's no semicolon for that line because the block ends before the closing brace? Or maybe the braces are misplaced. Let me check each part.

In C-like languages, an if-else structure should be properly indented and closed with a single brace or a pair of curly braces. Here, it seems like after the else statement, there's no condition attached to it because it's inside another block.

Looking at the code again: The if condition is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

Wait, that last } is actually outside of any block. So after the else statement, there should be an else clause with its own braces or without? Actually, in C-like languages, you can have if-else as:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

Or sometimes written inline without curly braces, but each part needs to end before the next starts.

In this code, after `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` there's an else followed by `b = 2;`, but it doesn't have braces. So maybe that's causing a syntax error because in C-like languages, each statement must be properly enclosed or separated with semicolons and correct braces.

Wait, no, actually in C, you can write if-else statements without braces, but they have to be on the same line as the condition. But looking at the code, after `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`, there's an extra closing brace at the end which might not be needed.

Wait, no, the original code ends with two closing braces: one after `a = 1;` and another at the very end. So that's probably incorrect.

Let me think again: The structure is if (condition) { statement; } else statement;

But in C-like languages, each of these must be properly enclosed. So perhaps the code should have an else block with braces or not? Alternatively, maybe there are two separate statements after if and else without proper block closures.

Wait, but looking at it again: The first part is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` which ends with a closing brace. Then comes `else b = 2;` which doesn't have braces around it. But in C-like languages, after else, you can either have another statement or an else-if chain.

Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to write if (x>0) then set a=1, else do something without using else if, but perhaps that's not valid syntax because 'else' needs to be followed by a condition and then a block.

Wait, no. The correct structure in C-like languages is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

or

if (condition) statement; else statement;

So in this case, the code after if has an else without any condition or braces, which would be invalid because else must have its own block.

Wait, no. In some languages like JavaScript, you can write:

if (x>0) { a=1 } else b=2

without curly braces, but each statement is on separate lines with proper indentation. So maybe the issue here is that after 'else', there's an assignment without a closing brace.

Alternatively, perhaps the code has two statements inside if and else blocks because of missing braces. Let me count the braces:

The first line ends with ` }` for the if block. Then comes else b=2; followed by another `}` which is probably incorrect.

Wait, let's see: The original code as given is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first }, there's an else statement with no braces. Then at the end, another } without any corresponding block.

That would mean that the final } is trying to close something but doesn't have anything, which might be causing the syntax error because of missing braces or incorrect placement.

Alternatively, maybe the code should not have a closing brace after else and just use semicolons for each statement. So perhaps it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Without that final } which is probably an extra one added by mistake.

Wait, let me count the braces: The first line has `}` at the end after 'a=1;', then another `}` at the very end. So in total, there are two closing braces where only one is needed if else is written without a block.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was intended to be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But that would add an extra set of braces which may not be necessary. Alternatively, in some languages like JavaScript, you can write it as:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

Which doesn't use braces at all.

So maybe the issue is that the code has two closing braces, one after 'a=1;' and another after 'else ...' which makes an extra } that's not needed. So perhaps removing the last } would fix it because it's causing a syntax error by having an unmatched brace.

Alternatively, if else must have its own block without braces in some languages, then maybe the code is correct except for the missing closing brace after else. Wait, but looking at the original code: After `a = 1;` there's one }, then else b=2; followed by another } which would close a previous block incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps it's that the 'else' statement is not properly enclosed within braces, leading to an error because in C-like languages, after else you need to have an if-else structure with braces or at least no extra closing brace.

Alternatively, maybe the code should just end after the else statement without adding another } which doesn't correspond to any block. So perhaps the correct fix is to remove the last } so that it's not there anymore.

So in conclusion, I think the main issue is an extra closing brace at the end of the code, making it have two } instead of one where necessary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
