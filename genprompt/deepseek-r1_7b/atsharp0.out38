Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

```fix
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, okay, so there's an if statement here, and inside it, someone tried to use `@` which looks like a comment start in C or other languages. But in Python, that's not valid syntax.

Wait, I remember that in Python, you can't mix different syntax styles unless they're within the same string, but even then, that's usually for code comments using triple quotes. Here, it seems someone tried to use an inline comment with `#` inside a function or script block, which isn't allowed because once the interpreter hits a `#`, everything after is considered a comment until the end of the line.

So the problem here is that the person used `@` before `a = 1`, which is incorrect in Python. In Python, to create an annotation for a class or function, you use `@`, but outside of that context, it's invalid syntax. 

Looking at the code structure, there's also some extra comments at the end with `# else b = 2; #` which aren't necessary and might not even be valid because each line must have an annotation if using `@`.

I think the best approach is to remove those lines entirely since they're causing syntax errors. The original intention was probably to write a conditional statement, maybe in another language that supports annotations on each line, but in Python, you can't do that unless it's within a class or function definition.

So by removing all the `@` and the trailing comments, the code should work correctly without any syntax errors.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error because of the use of `@` outside its intended context (within annotations) and improper line breaks. To fix this, remove the erroneous lines.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

The fixed code is:

```fix
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
