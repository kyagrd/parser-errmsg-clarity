Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code first:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, the user mentioned that the syntax might be different from languages like C, Java, or Python, but I know some basics so maybe I can figure it out.

First, I notice there are these symbols 《 and 》 which look a bit like brackets. Maybe they're supposed to replace regular parentheses? Let me check the code structure.

The line starts with an if statement: if (x > 0). Then inside, there's this part: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Wait, that seems off. In most programming languages, after an if condition, you have braces {} to enclose the statements. So maybe these 《 and 》 are supposed to be used instead of curly braces.

Looking at the code again: after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there's a 《 which probably starts a block. Then inside is 'a = 1;', followed by a closing 》. But then outside that, there's another 》 before else and so on. That doesn't make sense because in most languages, each block should be properly nested.

Wait, perhaps the code was trying to use angle brackets or some other symbols but got it wrong. Alternatively, maybe they're meant to represent curly braces but were used incorrectly.

Let me think about how this would look with correct syntax using curly braces:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So the code starts with if (x>0), then opens a block, does a=1, closes it, then else and the other block.

In the given code, they used 《 and 》 instead of {}. So probably replacing those would fix the syntax. Also, the structure is incorrect because there are two closing brackets after each other, which isn't valid.

So I'll replace both instances of 《 and 》 with { and }, then adjust the spacing or line breaks as needed.

Let me write it step by step:

Original code:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Replacing 《 with {, but looking at how they're used. The first 《 starts after x>0, so probably the opening brace is on the same line or next line.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to structure each statement properly.

So:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That makes sense. So I need to add { after if and before }, and similarly for else.

Looking back at the original code, there are two closing brackets which is wrong. So that's another issue causing the syntax error. By replacing them with correct braces and adjusting the line breaks, it should fix the problem.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect use of 《》 characters instead of curly braces `{}` for block delimiters. Additionally, the structure isn't properly formatted.

Here is the fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

So the output is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
