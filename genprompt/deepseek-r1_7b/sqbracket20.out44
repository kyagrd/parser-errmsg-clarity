Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error and gave me some code to work with. Let me look at it carefully.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I know that in programming, when you have an if-else statement, the structure should be consistent. So let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the if condition: `if (x > 0)`. That seems fine on its own. The problem might be with what's after it.

Then there's `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Wait, that looks odd. In many languages like C or Java, after an if statement, you have the block of code inside curly braces `{}`, and then the else part also has its own block. But in this case, it starts with square brackets `[` instead of curly braces.

So maybe the user intended to use square brackets for some reason, but that's not standard syntax in most languages. But looking at the error message, it just says "syntax error." So perhaps the issue is more about the structure of the code rather than using brackets or semicolons incorrectly.

Another thing I notice is that after the if statement, there's only one square bracket `[ a = 1; ]`. Then outside of that, there's an else clause `else b = 2;` but it also ends with a square bracket `]`. That doesn't seem right because in languages like C or Java, each block is within its own braces. So having two separate blocks without proper nesting might be causing the syntax error.

Wait, maybe the user is using a different language where square brackets are allowed for arrays or something else, but that's probably not relevant here. The main issue is likely with how the if and else clauses are structured.

Let me think about the correct structure. It should be:

if (condition) {
    // code block
} else {
    // other code block
}

So in this case, perhaps the user intended to write it using curly braces but mistakenly used square brackets. Or maybe they're trying to use a different syntax altogether.

Looking at the error message, it's just "syntax error," which is pretty vague. But considering that the problem might be with the lack of proper block closing, I can adjust the code accordingly.

Wait, in the given code, after the if statement, there's `[ a = 1; ]` and then `else b = 2; ]`. So perhaps the else part is also wrapped in square brackets. That would mean that both blocks are using `[` and `]`, which might not be necessary or correct.

So maybe the correct approach is to replace those square brackets with curly braces, as they're more standard for code blocks. Let me try rewriting the code accordingly.

So changing `[ a = 1; ]` to `{ a = 1; }` and similarly adjusting the else part if needed.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That should fix the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed within curly braces, which are standard in most programming languages. Also, ensuring that each if and else statement has its corresponding opening and closing braces.

Alternatively, if the user intended to use square brackets for some reason, maybe it's part of a specific language they're using where arrays or something else uses those. But without more context, I think replacing them with curly braces is safer and aligns with common practices.

So yeah, that should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
