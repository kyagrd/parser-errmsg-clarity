Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I remember that in many programming languages like C or Java, when you have an if-else statement, you can't just end it with a closing bracket and then another line without some structure. Looking at the code, after the if condition, there's a square bracket [ and inside is a semicolon, which seems off.

The error message says "syntax error," so I think something is wrong with how the brackets are used. In C or similar languages, you can use compound conditions with braces {} for multiple statements, but here it's using square brackets [ ]. Maybe that's causing an issue because square brackets aren't recognized correctly in this context.

Looking at the code structure: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that after the if block, there's another statement outside. But the way it's written might be causing the syntax error because the else is attached without proper structure inside the first bracket.

Perhaps the correct approach is to remove the square brackets and use braces {} instead. So the code should look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That way, each statement inside the if-else block has its own curly braces, which are standard in C-like languages. This would fix the syntax error because it properly structures the statements within the conditional.

I should check if there are any other issues, but this change seems to address the immediate problem by correcting the bracket type and structure.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
