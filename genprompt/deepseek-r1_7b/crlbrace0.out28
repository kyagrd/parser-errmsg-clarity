Thinking...
Okay, so I have to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me look at what's given. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, right away I notice something's off with the structure of the if statement. Normally, an if-else statement should have both blocks indented under their respective conditions. In this case, after the if block, there's only one curly brace and then another statement outside but not properly enclosed.

Wait, looking at it again: if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

Oh, I see! The problem is that the else part isn't within an if statement. So the else should be attached to the if condition, and each block should have its own curly braces.

So the correct structure would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a =1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

I think that's all that's needed here. The original code missed the opening brace for the else part and didn't properly indent it, causing a syntax error because the statements aren't correctly grouped.
...done thinking.

The fix involves adding an opening curly brace after the `else` keyword to properly enclose the second block of code.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }
```
