Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, let me look at the code. It starts with an if statement checking if x is greater than 0. Then there's this `@ a = 1` part. I remember that in many programming languages like C or JavaScript, you can't just put symbols like @ before variable assignments. Maybe it's not valid syntax here.

Wait, the error message only mentions a syntax error, so perhaps using the symbol @ is incorrect. Instead of @, maybe there should be an equals sign = for assignment. So instead of `@ a`, it should be `= a`.

Also, I notice there are two comment markers at the end: `# else b = 2; #`. In some languages like C, you use /* */ comments instead of `#` because `#` is used for compiling preprocessor stuff. So maybe those shouldn't be there.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should remove the @ and use an equals sign. Also, remove the comment markers since they might not be appropriate here or cause issues if treated as actual comments.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) = a = 1; /* else b = 2; */
```
