Thinking...
Alright, let's take a look at this problem. The user provided some code with a syntax error and an error message. They want me to fix the code without prior knowledge of programming languages, just using the given error message.

First, I'll examine the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error is a syntax error, so there's something wrong with how the code is structured. Let me break it down line by line.

Starting with the if statement: `if (x > 0)`. That seems fine on its own. Then comes `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Hmm, I notice that after the if condition, there's a square bracket `[`, which is unexpected. In many programming languages, square brackets are used for arrays or other structures and can't appear right after an if statement without proper syntax.

Next, inside the if block, they have `a = 1;` which looks like a simple assignment. But then another square bracket closes the if block with `] else b = 2; ]`. Wait, that's not correct because in most languages, the closing of an if-else structure uses a keyword like `end`, `endif`, or just proper indentation and structure.

Wait, looking at the code again, it seems like they're trying to use square brackets for something. Maybe the initial `[` is part of an array? But then after the if block, another square bracket appears which might be incorrect because it's not properly closing anything.

Let me think about possible corrections. One approach could be to remove the square brackets and see if that makes sense. So replacing `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]` with `else b = 2;`. Let's see:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Does this make sense? It looks like an if-else statement where if x is greater than 0, assign 1 to a; else, assign 2 to b. That seems grammatically correct and removes the extra brackets which were causing the syntax error.

Alternatively, maybe the square brackets are meant for something else, but without knowing the context of the programming language, removing them might be the safest fix based on the given constraints.

I should also check if there's any missing semicolon or comma. In the original code, after `[ a = 1; ]`, the else statement starts with `else b = 2; ]`. The extra square bracket at the end of the else part is probably causing an issue because it's not properly closed.

So removing the extra brackets and ensuring proper syntax by placing the if condition correctly should fix the error. The corrected code would have the if block followed directly, without unnecessary brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
