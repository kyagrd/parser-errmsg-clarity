Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message is just "syntax error," which means there's something wrong with the structure of the code. Let me look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement has an opening curly brace after the condition and then another closing brace after the else statement. That might be causing issues because in most programming languages, each block should have its own braces correctly matched.

Wait, let me count the braces. The if part is inside { }, which seems correct. Then there's an else statement followed by a semicolon and another }. But without any corresponding opening brace for that last }.

So it looks like after the else b = 2; line, the code has an extra closing brace at the end of the if block. That would cause a syntax error because the braces aren't properly closed or matched.

To fix this, I should remove the trailing closing brace so that each block is correctly enclosed. Let me try adjusting it:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Yes, by removing the last }, the code now has properly nested braces without any mismatch. This should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has an extra closing curly brace which is causing the syntax error. By removing this misplaced brace, we fix the issue.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
