Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where the user provided some code that's causing a syntax error. The code they have is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And the output needs to be fixed using only the given error message without any pre-trained knowledge.

First, I recognize that in programming languages like C or JavaScript, an if statement's syntax requires curly braces {} to enclose the block of code. Looking at the code, inside the if condition, there's a semicolon after 'a = 1;' but no opening brace before the closing parenthesis.

So, it seems the problem is that the user forgot to add the opening curly brace { right after the if statement. Without this, the compiler doesn't know which statements are part of the if block and expects more code inside the braces.

To fix this, I need to add an opening curly brace before 'if (x > 0)'. That way, both lines within the condition will be properly enclosed, resolving the syntax error.

So the corrected code should look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

This adds the necessary braces to properly structure the if-else block and adhere to the language's syntax rules.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
