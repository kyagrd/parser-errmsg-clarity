Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```fixme
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Wait, I see that there's an extra closing brace at the end. The if statement starts with `{` and ends with `}`, then the else clause has its own statements but it doesn't have braces around them? Or maybe not.

Let me check: The code is written as:
- if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;
But I see that after the else, there's another closing brace. So actually, the structure is like this:

if (condition) { ... } else ... }

Wait, no. Looking at it again, the code is written as:
if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }
So the first part is if with braces, then else without braces and another brace after that.

But in JavaScript or other languages, an else clause doesn't need to have braces around its statements. So maybe the issue isn't with the else but with the extra closing brace at the end.

Let me count the braces:
- The first if statement opens a {, which is correct.
- Then inside it, a=1; and } closes that block.
- Then comes } else... Wait, no. Let's parse line by line:

Line 1: if (x>0) {
Line 2:    a =1;
Line3: }
Then the code has an else followed by b=2;, but then another }, which is at the end.

Wait, actually, looking again, maybe it's not correctly structured. The code as written would have:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

But that last } is causing the error because there's an unexpected brace after else.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code had proper braces but was miswritten here. So maybe in the user's code, they have one closing brace too many.

So to fix it, I need to remove that extra closing brace at the end. Let me check:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

There's an extra } after else. So removing that should solve the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended for both branches to have their own blocks but forgot to close them properly. But in this case, since the if has braces and the else doesn't need it, I think the main issue is the trailing brace causing a syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace that's not needed after the `else`. Removing the extra brace fixes the syntax.

```fixme
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Problem:** The error message indicates an unexpected '}' after the else clause, implying an extra closing brace.
   
2. **Analyze the Code Structure:**
   - The code has `if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }`
   - Notice there's an extra `}` at the very end.

3. **Determine the Fix:** Remove the extra closing brace to eliminate the syntax error.

4. **Resulting Code:**
   ```
   if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
   ```

This corrected code removes the extraneous brace, resolving the syntax issue without altering the intended functionality.
