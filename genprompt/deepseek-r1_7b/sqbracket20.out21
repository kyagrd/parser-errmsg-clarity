Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there's an if statement followed by some brackets and then an else clause. But in most programming languages like C or Java, braces {} are used around blocks of code, not square brackets []. So maybe the brackets here are incorrect.

Also, after the if condition, there's [ a = 1; ], which ends with ]; but I see that the next line is ] else b=2; ]. Wait, so it looks like there are two closing braces? Or maybe just one. Let me count.

The code starts with if (x>0) then [, and inside that bracket is a=1;. Then outside the bracket, there's an else followed by b=2; ], but I see two ] at the end. So perhaps the structure is wrong because of the extra closing brace.

Wait, in the original code, after the [a = 1;], the next line starts with ] else ..., so maybe the brackets are mismatched. Let me try to parse it:

- The if statement opens a block with [
- Inside that block, there's an assignment a=1;
- Then outside the block, there's else b=2; ]

But in this case, the else is outside the initial [ ] because of the ; after else... So maybe the issue is that the square brackets are not properly used. In many languages, you don't need square brackets around an assignment like a = 1;. Instead, it should be inside braces {}.

So perhaps the code was intended to have if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }, but without the braces, maybe that's causing confusion. But actually, in most languages, you don't need the square brackets around assignments within conditionals.

Alternatively, looking at the error message, it says syntax error. So perhaps the issue is with the use of square brackets where they shouldn't be. Maybe those should be replaced with curly braces or removed entirely because they're not necessary for assignment statements.

So let me think about each part:

1. The initial [ after if (x>0) is incorrect. In languages like C, Java, JavaScript, you don't use square brackets to enclose the body of an if statement. Instead, you use curly braces or semicolons with proper indentation.

2. Similarly, the ] at the end before else is also a problem because it closes the first block prematurely.

3. The else statement is followed by b=2; but then there's another ] which might be causing a syntax error because of mismatched brackets.

So perhaps the correct approach is to replace the square brackets with curly braces or remove them entirely since they're not necessary for assignment statements in this context.

Let me try rewriting it:

- Remove the [ after if (x>0) and before a=1;
- Use curly braces instead.
- Also, make sure that each block has its own set of braces.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That makes sense. The square brackets were causing the syntax error because they're not used in assignment statements within conditionals. Instead, we use curly braces to denote blocks of code.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect use of square brackets where assignment operators are placed without proper block delimiters. Square brackets are unnecessary around assignments and should be replaced with curly braces.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
