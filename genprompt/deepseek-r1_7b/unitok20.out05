Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code snippet with a syntax error, and I need to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge except for what's given in the problem. The user mentioned that the syntax might be different from languages like C, Java, or Python, but there are some symbols available based on the error message.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

First, I notice that this isn't valid syntax for any language I know. But let's break it down. The if statement starts with "if (x > 0)", which seems correct. Then there's an opening angle bracket before the line where a=1; is written.

Wait, in many programming languages, the closing bracket should come after the statements inside the condition. So maybe the structure here is wrong. Let me think about how if-else blocks are typically structured.

In most languages, it would be:

if (condition) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}

So applying that to this code, I see that after "if (x > 0)", there's an opening angle bracket 《 before the a=1; line. That doesn't look right because usually, we don't use 《 and 》 for if-else in common languages like C++ or Java.

Wait, maybe it's using some custom syntax where brackets are represented differently. But given that the error is a syntax error, perhaps the placement of the angle brackets is incorrect.

Looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I think the problem is that there's an extra closing bracket at the end. The structure should be if ... } else ..., but in this case, it seems like two brackets are opened and then not properly closed.

So maybe the correct structure would have one opening brace for each condition. Let me try to restructure it:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That makes sense because each if-else block is enclosed in its own braces. So I think replacing the 《 and 》 with curly braces {} would fix the syntax error.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should have curly braces instead of angle brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
