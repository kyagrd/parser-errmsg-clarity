Thinking...
Alright, let's look at this code and see what's wrong with it. The user provided a code snippet:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The error message is a syntax error. Hmm, I remember that in many programming languages like C or Java, using square brackets for array accesses isn't allowed in conditionals. So the [ and ] here are probably causing issues.

Looking at the code structure: it's an if-else statement. The user wants to fix this without changing too much, just using symbols mentioned in the error message, which include things like semicolons, commas, etc., but not much else since they're talking about syntax errors.

So first, I'll check the brackets. In some languages, you can use square brackets for conditions if it's allowed, but here the code seems to have an array-like structure inside the if condition. That might not be valid in this context because maybe it's expecting a single expression after the if without any additional structures.

Wait, another thing I notice is that within the else clause, there's only a semicolon and then 'b = 2; ]' with a closing bracket at the end. That extra bracket could be causing an issue. Maybe it should just be 'b = 2;' without the trailing bracket because the code doesn't seem to have any more statements after that.

Putting this together, I think the problem is twofold: the square brackets in the if condition and the trailing closing bracket after else. So to fix it, I'll replace the square brackets with parentheses where appropriate or remove them if not needed. Also, removing the extra closing bracket at the end of the else statement should resolve the syntax error.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That way, we've removed the problematic square brackets and fixed the trailing semicolon by adding it correctly without an extra bracket. This should eliminate the syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
