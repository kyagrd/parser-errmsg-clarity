Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, the problem is with the '#' symbol in the wrong place.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I notice that there are two '#' symbols at the end. In many programming languages, especially those inspired by C or similar, '#' is used for comments. But here, it's placed after the else clause and another statement, which isn't correct.

The code seems to be mixing some conditional logic with comment syntax. The structure looks like an if-else block but instead of proper indentation and colon, there are comments that aren't needed.

So, first, I should remove the '#' symbols because they're causing a syntax error. That would fix the issue where the interpreter is confused about the unexpected '#'.

Next, looking at the code without the #s:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Wait, I see an '@' symbol here. That's unusual in most languages. Maybe it's part of some syntax that's not intended here. Perhaps the user meant to write an if-else statement without any operators like '@'.

So, removing the '@' as well would make sense because it doesn't fit into a standard if-else structure.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wait, but in many languages, you don't need braces for single-line conditions. So maybe just:
```
if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;
```

Yes, that makes more sense and avoids the syntax error by removing the '#' and '@' symbols.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
