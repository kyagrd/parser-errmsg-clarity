Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this syntax error problem step by step. The user provided a code snippet with an error message indicating a syntax issue. My task is to fix it using only the information from the error message and without prior knowledge of the specific language used.

First, I'll look at the given code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error message says there's a syntax error. So, I need to find where the mistake is in this code.

I notice that the condition after `else` ends with `b = 2; ]`. Wait, it has two closing brackets: one for the if statement and another extra at the end. That might be causing the issue because each block should have only one bracket pair.

Looking closer, inside the `if` statement's condition `(x > 0)`, there's an opening square bracket `[` followed by a semicolon and a closing brace `]`. But in programming languages like JavaScript or Java, after an if-else statement, we don't use brackets; instead, each block is indented. So the code as written might be treating those brackets incorrectly.

So, I think the problem is that there are two sets of brackets: one for the if condition and another extra at the end, which isn't needed because it's after `else`. The correct structure should have only a single set of brackets around the true block and another around the false block. But in this case, both blocks aren't necessary or might be causing duplication.

To fix it, I'll remove the extra closing bracket at the end so that each block is correctly enclosed once. That means taking out the second `]` after `else b = 2;`. Also, since those square brackets were unnecessary around the statements inside, removing them would clean up the code and eliminate the syntax error.

So the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wait, but in some languages, you can use semicolons instead of curly braces for single-statement blocks. So another way could be:
```
if (x > 0) [a = 1] else [b = 2]
```

But since the original code uses semicolons, it's safer to keep them consistent. Hence, replacing the square brackets with curly braces makes more sense here.

So I'll adjust that as well. The final corrected code would have each if-else block enclosed in curly braces without any extra brackets.
...done thinking.

The error is due to incorrect bracket usage and an unnecessary closing bracket at the end of the else clause. The fix involves replacing square brackets with curly braces and removing the duplicate closing bracket.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, I made another mistake in my thought process earlier. Let me correct that. 

The proper way to structure it is:

```fix
if (x > 0){a=1;}else{b=2;}
```

So the final answer is as above.

Final Answer:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
But since some languages allow semicolons, it can be:

Alternatively:
```fix
if (x>0)[a=1];else[b=2]
```
