Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error" and the code that's supposed to be fixed. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, let's look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or JavaScript, if statements usually have an opening and closing brace. The user wrote `[` and `]`, which might be placeholders for braces. But the way it's structured here seems off.

The code starts with an if condition: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. I notice that after the if block, there's an else statement without any opening brace, and then another closing brace. That probably means something is wrong because braces should be matched correctly.

Wait, in many languages like JavaScript or C++, each if-else clause needs to be properly enclosed with braces. So maybe the user used `[` and `]` as comments or placeholders for actual braces but didn't use them correctly.

Looking closer, the code has `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The first part is inside brackets, which might have been intended to be an if block, but then it's followed by an else statement outside. But that doesn't make sense because in an if-else structure, both should be within the same braces.

So perhaps the correct structure should be using actual curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets `[ ]`. Let me think about how this code should look with proper braces.

The corrected code would likely have:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each block is enclosed within its own curly braces. The original code used square brackets which are not valid syntax for if statements in most languages, hence the syntax error.

I should make sure that I'm only changing the code to use the correct braces and removing any unnecessary ones. So replacing `[` with `{` and `]` with `}` would fix the issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
