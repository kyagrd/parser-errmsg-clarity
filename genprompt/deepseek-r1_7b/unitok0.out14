Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided the error message "syntax error" and the code they want to fix is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first thing I notice is those weird symbols, 《 and 》, which aren't part of standard syntax. They look like they might be intended to represent some kind of formatting or emphasis, maybe like HTML comments? But in plain text code, that's not valid. So probably, the user meant to use regular parentheses instead.

Looking at the structure, it seems like they're trying to write an if-else statement. The original code has "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". If I replace the 《 and 》 with normal parentheses, it would look like:

if (x > 0) (a = 1; ) else b = 2;

Wait, but that's not correct. The if statement should only have one block of code when the condition is true. So having both the a=1 and b=2 inside might be an issue. Let me think about how to structure this correctly.

In an if-else statement, there are two blocks: one for when the condition is true, and another for when it's false. Each block should have only one compound statement, unless using braces, but that's more for multiple statements.

So perhaps the code was intended to be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each block is properly enclosed within curly braces. But in the original code, they didn't use braces and had extra symbols which caused the syntax error.

So replacing the special characters with parentheses isn't enough because it changes the control flow structure incorrectly. Instead, using proper braces would fix both the syntax and the logic of the conditionals.

I should also check for any missing semicolons or colons, but in this case, a=1; has a semicolon which is correct, and b=2 doesn't need one because it's an assignment statement without needing a semicolon. Wait, actually, in many languages like JavaScript, you do need a semicolon after an assignment. So maybe the else part should have "b=2;" instead of just "b=2".

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense. It fixes the syntax by using proper braces and ensures each statement ends with a semicolon.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by invalid characters `《` and `》`. These should be replaced with regular parentheses `( )`.

Here's the fixed code:

if (x > 0) (a = 1; ) else (b = 2);

But this still isn't correct syntax because an if-else statement requires each condition to have its own block. The proper way is to use curly braces `{}` for blocks.

The corrected code with proper syntax and structure:

if (x > 0) {  
    a = 1;  
} else {  
    b = 2;  
}

So the final fixed code is:
```fix
if (x > 0) {  
    a = 1;  
} else {  
    b = 2;  
}
```
