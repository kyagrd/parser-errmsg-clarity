Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error and an error message pointing out the issue. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I need to fix this using only the provided error message as a reference. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, looking at the structure of the if statement. In most programming languages, an if statement should have braces {} for block structures, especially when there are multiple statements inside or when you want to nest conditions. Here, I see [ and ] instead of braces.

The code starts with "if (x > 0) [" which is unusual because it uses square brackets [ ]. In many languages like JavaScript or PHP, using square brackets can cause syntax errors unless they're part of an array or indexed structure. But in this case, maybe the user intended to use curly braces {} instead.

Next, inside the if block, there's "a = 1; ]" Notice that after a=1;, there's another ]. That might be an issue because it could be closing a block prematurely or incorrectly. The else statement is outside of both [ and ], which doesn't make sense because in an if-else structure, each condition should have its own block.

So putting this together, the code likely has two issues: using square brackets instead of curly braces for blocks and improper nesting causing the extra closing bracket at the end.

I'll start by replacing the square brackets with curly braces. So the if statement becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

Wait, but in this case, there's only one line inside the if block, which is fine. But looking back, the else part was written as "else b = 2; ]". That extra ] at the end is problematic because it closes something that wasn't opened properly.

So I'll adjust the code to have each condition with its own block. The corrected structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }

This way, each if-else has its own braces, and there's no mismatched or extra brackets.

Wait, but in the original code, after else there was another ] which wasn't necessary. So removing that extra bracket should fix it.

Putting it all together, I'll change both square brackets to curly braces for both the if and else blocks, making sure each has its own pair without nesting issues.
...done thinking.

The error is due to using square brackets instead of curly braces `{}` for block structures in the if statement. Here's the fixed code:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else b = 2;
```

The final output inside triple backticks is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
