Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the code is part of a different language, not something like C or Java, but maybe something else where these symbols are used differently.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I notice there's an if statement. In many programming languages, after an if condition, you have a block of code indented inside parentheses or brackets. Here, it starts with `[` which is unusual because in Python, for example, the indentation follows the keyword like `if`, but here it's using square brackets.

Wait, maybe this is JavaScript? But usually, blocks are denoted with `{}`, not square brackets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding of syntax. Let me think about each part.

The code starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then there's `[ a = 1; ]` which is unexpected because the opening bracket isn't followed by a colon in JavaScript, for example. So maybe that's incorrect.

Also, after the else clause, it has `else b = 2; ]`. The closing bracket here might be causing an issue because it's not properly closed before.

Putting this together, perhaps the brackets are unnecessary or misplaced. Maybe the user intended to use braces `{}` for code blocks instead of square brackets `[ ]`. Alternatively, maybe the structure is wrong.

Another angle: in some languages like C, you have if-else with curly braces, but sometimes people use square brackets mistakenly. So replacing [ with { might fix it.

So let me try rewriting the code:

Original:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Proposed fix: Replace the square brackets with curly braces for both blocks.
Resulting in:
```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```

This way, each condition has its own block properly enclosed with curly braces. The if and else statements are correctly followed by their respective code blocks without any syntax errors.

I don't see any other issues in this approach. It addresses the misplaced brackets and ensures proper scoping of the variables a and b.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```
