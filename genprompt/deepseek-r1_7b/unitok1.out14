Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem again.

The user provided an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, there's a misplaced character here.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I see that there are some angle brackets used instead of parentheses. The user mentioned using only the error message and not prior knowledge, so I shouldn't assume what the correct brackets are.

The code starts with `if (x > 0)`, which is correct. Then it has `《 a = 1; 》`—the angle bracket '《' seems out of place here. Similarly, after the else clause, there's another '》'.

I think the user intended to use parentheses for the if statement and brackets or braces for the else block. But since in JavaScript, we typically use curly braces `{}`, maybe that's where the issue is.

Wait, but looking at the code structure: The `if` condition ends with a closing parenthesis, then comes `《`, which doesn't match. Then inside the else clause, there's another angle bracket. It seems like the developer tried to use brackets instead of parentheses or vice versa.

So perhaps replacing the '》' and '《' with regular parentheses '(' ')' would fix it. Alternatively, if using different brackets, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, in JavaScript, after an `if` statement's condition, you typically don't put any special characters unless you're adding something like a comment or an annotation. So the angle brackets here are causing issues because they're unexpected after the else clause.

Looking closer: The code is written as:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
It seems that between `if` and `else`, there's an angle bracket, which isn't valid syntax. So perhaps the correct approach is to remove those angle brackets.

So the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
But wait, in JavaScript, you can use curly braces for block statements. Alternatively, if it's just a single statement inside the condition and its else, using parentheses is fine.

So maybe the user intended to have regular parentheses around `a=1` and then an else clause with another set of parentheses or semicolons.

Wait, actually, looking again: The original code has:
- After `if (x>0)`, there's 《 a =1;》
Then, `else b=2;` followed by another 》

So the structure is messed up because after the if condition closes, it expects an opening brace or something. So maybe the angle brackets were misplaced.

I think replacing all angle brackets with regular parentheses would fix this. Let me try:

Change:
- The first 《 to (
- The 》 after a=1; to )
Then, remove the extra closing ) before else and after that.

Wait, no, perhaps just removing the angle brackets entirely. Because in JavaScript, between if and condition, we don't put any special characters unless it's part of an annotation or something, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

So, rewriting the code without the angle brackets should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by using angle brackets (》) where parentheses are expected. The corrected code uses standard parentheses and semicolons appropriately.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
