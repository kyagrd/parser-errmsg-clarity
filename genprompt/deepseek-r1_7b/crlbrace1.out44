Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means the if statement was already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, okay, so I see that the if statement starts with "if (x > 0) {" and then inside it, there's an assignment a = 1;. Then, after the closing brace of the if block, there's an else followed by another assignment b = 2; but it ends with an extra }.

Wait, no, looking again, actually, the code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the else, there's another statement outside the if block. But in this case, the structure might be causing a problem because of the placement of braces.

Let me parse it step by step. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But wait, actually, looking at how it's written with the curly braces: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I think the issue is that after the if statement's closing }, there's an else which doesn't have its own block. So maybe the code is structured incorrectly.

Wait, no, in the given code, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So the else is right after the if closing brace. That means that the else is part of the outer code level, not nested inside any block.

But the error message says there's an unexpected '}' after else. So maybe there's an extra closing brace somewhere.

Looking at it again, I think the problem is that the else statement doesn't have its own braces unless specified. But in this case, perhaps the code intended to write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But without the braces around the else's assignment, it might not be causing an error because else is just a keyword and doesn't need braces unless there are multiple statements. But in this case, maybe the code has a mismatched brace.

Wait, looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block closes with }, then 'else' is written outside of any block because there's no opening brace for it. Then, the next line starts with else followed by b=2;, which would be at the same indentation level as the if statement.

But then after that, there's another closing brace } before the end of the code. That might be causing a syntax error because the else block is expecting to have its own braces.

Wait, maybe it's better to restructure this. Perhaps the original code intended to have both conditions inside their respective blocks.

So the correct way would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But in the given code, after the if block closes with }, there's an else statement and then another }. So perhaps the extra } is causing the issue because it's closing something that shouldn't be closed.

Wait, no. In the original code, after the if (x>0) { a=1; }, the code has } else b=2; }

So maybe the structure is:

if (...) { ... } else ...

But without braces around 'else', which would mean it's treated as a single statement. However, in this case, perhaps there's an extra closing brace at the end.

Alternatively, looking back, the user provided the code as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the else statement, there's another }, which might be causing the problem. Because in reality, each block should have its own braces.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the braces.

The code is:

Line 1: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So let's parse this as follows:

- Line starts with if, then condition.
- Then { a=1; }, so inside the if block.
- Then 'else', which should be indented but isn't. Wait no, in code, indentation doesn't affect syntax unless there are braces.

Wait, perhaps it's structured like:

if (x>0) {
    a = 1;
} else
    b = 2;

But that would require proper spacing and alignment, but the error is about unexpected '}' which suggests a mismatched brace.

Alternatively, maybe the code was intended to have both conditions inside their own blocks. So perhaps the correct structure is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Which would avoid any extra braces or incorrect placements.

So considering that, I think the original code had an extra closing brace at the end after the else statement. So to fix it, we need to remove that extra }, so the code becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But wait, does that make sense? Let me check.

Wait, in the original code, there's an extra '}' at the end. So when parsed correctly, it should have:

Line 1: if (...) { a=1; }

Then line 2: } else b=2;

And then line 3: }

Which would cause the parser to think that after the else statement ends, there's another }, which is unexpected.

So removing the extra closing brace at the end will fix it.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code was supposed to have braces around both conditions. So rewriting:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

That way, each condition has its own block, and no extra } is present.

But in the given code, there's an extra }, so probably we should remove it.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error, ensure that the if statement and else clause are properly enclosed with braces. Remove any extra closing braces causing the mismatch.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

The corrected code removes the misplaced closing brace after `else`, ensuring proper block structure without syntax errors.
