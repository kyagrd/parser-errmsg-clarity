Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And the error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means a closing bracket was used too early.

Hmm, so in the original code, after the if statement, they have '[ a = 1; ]'. That looks like a comment or maybe an array. But wait, it's inside an if condition without an opening curly brace. So when the compiler sees the first ']', it thinks that's closing the else clause too soon.

I remember that in JavaScript, you need to use curly braces {} for if-else statements, not square brackets []. Because square brackets are used for arrays or object literals. So using them inside a conditional without braces is invalid.

So the mistake here is probably that they're using square brackets instead of curly braces. Let me think: if I change [ ] to { }, would that fix it?

Let's see:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense. Now the code has an opening brace after the condition, so the if block is correctly enclosed. The else statement doesn't need its own block because in JS, the else clause is attached to the if without braces.

Wait, but wait—the else part also ends with a semicolon and then there's another ] at the end. Oh right, in the original code, after the else b = 2; statement, there was an extra ]. So that closing square bracket wasn't needed because it was misplaced.

So combining both issues: replacing [ ] with { }, and removing the extra ] at the end. Let me write the corrected code:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else
    b = 2;

Wait, but in this case, maybe using proper indentation makes it clearer. Alternatively, if I want to keep some of the original structure, perhaps not changing too much.

Alternatively, since the user didn't specify whether they wanted to split into multiple lines or not, just fixing the syntax would suffice. So the minimal change is replacing [ ] with { }, and removing the extra ] at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has an incorrect use of square brackets where curly braces should be used for if-else statements in JavaScript.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The original code incorrectly uses square brackets `[ ]` around `a = 1;`, which is not valid syntax for an if statement without braces.
2. Replace the square brackets with curly braces `{ }`.
3. Remove the extra closing bracket `]` at the end since it was improperly placed after the else statement.

The corrected code now properly uses braces to define the if-else blocks, fixing the syntax error.
