Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which means the if statement is already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see that the user mentioned using only the error message without prior knowledge, so I can't rely on knowing what '》' is. From the error, it's clear there's an extra closing bracket or parenthesis somewhere.

Looking at the code structure, the if statement starts with 'if (x > 0)'. Then there's a curly brace opening '《', followed by 'a = 1; 》'. Wait, that looks off. After the if block closes with '》', there's an else clause: 'else b = 2;'. But then another '》' at the end.

So probably, the code is meant to be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But in the given code, instead of using curly braces correctly, they're using these symbols which look like brackets or maybe other characters. The error mentions an unexpected '》' after the else clause, meaning that the if statement was closed too early.

So I think the issue is that the code has extra closing symbols at the end and missing opening ones inside. Let me count:

- The if condition opens with '(' but doesn't close properly.
- Then there's 《 which is probably a curly brace or another symbol, but not matching correctly.
- After the if block closes with '》', there's an else statement that should be followed by its own block.

But in the given code, after the else, there's another '》' which shouldn't be there. So I need to remove the extra closing symbols and ensure each block is properly closed.

So the corrected code should have:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each if-else block is correctly enclosed within curly braces without any extra '》' at the end.
...done thinking.

The error arises because there are mismatched closing symbols. The code incorrectly uses '《' and '》' which likely should be replaced with proper curly braces `{}` to properly enclose the statements.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
