Thinking...
Alright, let's see what the problem is here. The user provided a code snippet with a syntax error and an error message. My task is to fix the syntax by only looking at the given error message without any pre-trained knowledge beyond that.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
And the error message says: unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed).

Hmm, so I notice that in the code, there are brackets around each condition. In many programming languages like C or Java, if-else statements don't use square brackets. But here, maybe they're using some custom syntax.

Looking at the structure: the user wrote `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So after the else clause, there's an extra closing bracket which is causing the error.

The error message mentions that there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. That suggests that one too many brackets are being used somewhere.

Let me break it down:

- The if statement opens with `[`, then has `(x > 0)` inside.
- Then, `]` closes the if block.
- Inside the if block, there's a semicolon and an assignment: `a = 1;`.
- Then, else is written as `else b = 2;` but it seems like it's followed by another `]`, which is causing the error.

Wait, in the code provided, after `else`, the user wrote `b = 2; ]`. So that's an extra closing bracket. The correct structure should probably be just one closing bracket at the end of the if-else statement.

So maybe the original code was meant to have each condition inside square brackets, but perhaps in this syntax, it's not necessary or handled differently.

Alternatively, looking more carefully: the user wrote `[ a = 1; ]` after `if (x>0)`, which is correct for their custom syntax. But then they have an else clause without any bracket except at the end with another `]`.

Wait, in normal programming, if-else doesn't use brackets. So maybe this code is using some kind of block-based language where each statement inside needs to be properly closed.

So perhaps after `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;`, the extra `]` at the end is causing the error because it's closing something that shouldn't be closed yet.

Let me try to visualize:

The code is:
- if (x>0) followed by `[ a=1; ]`
- then else, which in normal syntax doesn't need brackets, but here maybe expects some structure.
But looking at the code again: after `else`, there's `b = 2; ]`. So that extra `]` is causing the issue.

So perhaps the correct code should have only one closing bracket at the end of the else statement. Therefore, the last `[ ]` should be removed or adjusted.

Wait, no, maybe in their syntax, each if-else block uses brackets for each part. Let me see:

The original code has:
if (x>0) [ a=1; ] else b=2; ]

So perhaps after `else`, it's supposed to have another `[` and then the assignment inside.

Wait, that would make more sense: if x>0 then do this, else do that. So maybe each block is enclosed in square brackets with their own semicolons.

But then why does the error message say unexpected ']' after else?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should only have one closing bracket at the end of the entire statement, not per part.

So looking again: if (x>0) [ a=1; ] else b=2;

This would mean that after `if`, there's `[ a=1; ] else b=2; ]`. So two closing brackets, which is incorrect because it closes before the else can be properly processed.

Therefore, the correct code should have only one closing bracket at the end of the entire statement. Let me try to fix that:

Change from:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

To:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

Wait, but then would the assignments be correctly inside their respective blocks? In some block-based languages, each assignment might need to be within its own bracket.

Alternatively, perhaps after `else`, there should be another `[` for that block.

Let me consider: if (x>0) [ a=1; ] else b=2; ]

But the error is at the end. So maybe instead of having two closing brackets, it's better to have only one:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

That way, each assignment is inside its own block.

Alternatively, perhaps in this syntax, if-else doesn't require square brackets at all. So the original code might be trying to use them but it's causing confusion.

Wait, maybe the correct structure should have `[ ... if ..., else ... ]` without any assignments within. But that seems unlikely because they have `a = 1;`.

Alternatively, perhaps in this syntax, each assignment is inside its own block. So:

if (x>0) [ a=1; ]
else [ b=2; ]

But then the semicolons would go after their respective brackets.

Wait, maybe the code should be written as:

if (x > 0)[ a = 1; ] else[ b = 2 ];

But that removes the trailing semicolon. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each assignment is part of its own statement within the if or else block. So the correct code would have:

if (x>0) [ a=1; ]
else    b=2;

Wait, but that uses `else` on its own without brackets, which might be valid depending on the syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps in this context, each conditional has its assignment inside square brackets, so:

if (x > 0)[a = 1;]
else [b = 2;]

But then each block is enclosed within its own brackets. So that would require two closing brackets at the end: one for the if and another for the else.

Wait, but in the original code, there's only one `]` after else. Let me try to reconstruct:

The user wrote:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So that has `[ a=1; ] else b=2; ]`.

Which means two closing brackets: one after the if block and another at the end, which is causing the error because there's nothing to close.

Therefore, removing the last `]` would fix it. So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

That way, only one closing bracket after the else block.
...done thinking.

The error occurs due to an extra closing bracket at the end of the statement which is not properly closed by any corresponding opening bracket. The code has been fixed by removing the trailing closing square bracket.

```fix
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
