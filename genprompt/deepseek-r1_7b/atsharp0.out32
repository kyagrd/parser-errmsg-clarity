Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I see that there's an if statement here, and inside it, there are some operators: @ and #. Wait, those aren't keywords in Python, so maybe they're causing issues.

First, the line starts with `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`—the @ symbol is being used here. I remember that in Python, @ is used for decorators or matrix multiplication, but not as an operator inside an if condition like that. So using it there might be causing a syntax error.

Then, the next line has `else b = 2;` with a # before it. The # could be intended to be a comment, so maybe that's okay. But in Python, indentation is important for control structures like if-else. The code doesn't have any proper indentation, which would definitely cause a syntax error.

Also, the way the conditions are written: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` and then immediately after with no new line or proper structure—it seems like these two lines should be part of an if-else block but they're not indented correctly. In Python, each level of indentation starts at 4 spaces by default.

So putting it all together: the code is missing proper indentation for the if statement and the else clause. The @ symbol isn't used correctly in this context either. To fix this, I should adjust the structure to have an if block with correct indents and use appropriate syntax.
...done thinking.

The original code has issues with improper indentation and incorrect operator usage. Here's how it can be fixed:

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Indent the `if` statement properly**: In Python, control structures like `if` need to be indented to denote a new block of code.

2. **Correctly structure the if-else clauses**: Each clause (if and else) should be indented under its respective condition.

3. **Remove unnecessary operators**: The `@` operator isn't appropriate in an `if` condition statement.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

**Fixed Code:**
```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
