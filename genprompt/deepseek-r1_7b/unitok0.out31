Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The original code is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see that there are some angle brackets 《 》 being used instead of parentheses or something else. In programming, especially in languages like C++ or Java, we use regular parentheses (). So it's likely that the code is using a different syntax highlighting approach and replacing them with 《 and 》 for visual purposes.

So first, I should replace those angle brackets with normal parentheses. That would fix any parsing issues since the interpreter probably expects () instead of 《》.

Looking at the structure, the if statement has an else clause. The code inside is a bit messy because it's written as two separate lines without proper indentation and semicolons are misplaced.

Let me rewrite this step by step.

First, correct the angle brackets to parentheses:
if (x > 0) (a = 1; ) else b = 2;

But wait, that leaves the code a bit run-on. It's better to break it into two lines for readability and add proper indentation.

So I'll structure it like this:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes more sense. Each condition has its block enclosed in curly braces, making the code cleaner and avoiding any syntax errors.

I think that's all. The main issues were using angle brackets instead of parentheses and improper formatting without proper indentation.
...done thinking.

The code had incorrect use of angle brackets and missing semicolons. Replacing them with regular parentheses and correcting the structure fixes the syntax error.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace 《 and 》 with ( and ).
2. Add proper line breaks and indentation for readability.
3. Ensure each statement ends with a semicolon correctly.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
