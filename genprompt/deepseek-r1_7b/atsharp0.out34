Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and gave me the specific code to work with.

Looking at the code:
```fixme
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
I notice there are two main issues here. First, there's an `@` symbol inside an `if` statement which isn't valid syntax in most programming languages like Python or JavaScript. The `@` is typically used for decorators in Python, but in this context, it doesn't make sense.

Second, the code ends with a `#`, which looks like a shebang comment, commonly found at the top of scripts. However, placing a shebang inside an `if` block isn't correct because it's not part of the script execution flow.

So, my approach is to remove the `@` symbol since it's causing a syntax error and isn't needed here. Additionally, I'll eliminate the shebang comment at the end because it doesn't belong within the `if` statement.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:
```fixme
if (x > 0) else b = 2;
```
This removes both the invalid `@` and the misplaced comment, fixing the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to an invalid `@` symbol inside an `if` statement. Additionally, there's an extraneous shebang comment at the end.

The fixed code is:
```fixme
if (x > 0) else b = 2;
```

Answer:
```fixme
if (x > 0) else b = 2;
```
