Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means a closing brace was found where it wasn't expected. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I see that the if statement is correctly closed with a single }, but then there's an else clause followed by another }. So maybe the braces aren't matching properly.

Wait, in many programming languages, each if must have its own corresponding block. In this code, the if has { and } around a=1; which is correct. Then after the closing }, there's an else statement followed by b=2;. But that else doesn't close until the next }, right?

But looking at the code, after the first }, the else is on the same line as another }, so it might be trying to close too soon. Let me count the braces.

The code starts with if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So from the start:
- The outer if has { at position 4 and } at position 8.
- Then after that, there's an else statement followed by another }, which is unexpected because it's closing the outer if's block prematurely.

Ah, so the problem is that the code tries to close the outer if block right after the else, but that's incorrect. The else should be part of the same if structure without ending the entire if block at once.

So how can I fix this? Maybe by moving the else statement inside the existing if's block or adjusting where the braces are.

Wait, in some languages like JavaScript or PHP, you can have else inside an if. But here, looking at the code again, perhaps it's intended to write something else after the first }.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake by placing another } too early. So instead of having two closing braces where one is needed.

Let me try to adjust the structure:

Option 1: Make sure that only the outer if block ends with a single }, and then have the else as part of it without ending prematurely.

So the correct code should be:

if (x >0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But wait, in this case, the else is attached to the same if. So the braces are only one pair. Let me count again: from the outer if's opening { at position 4, then after a=1;, there's a }, which closes that block. Then the else should be part of that same if statement without needing another } until the end.

So in this case, the code should have:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

Which means only one } at the end to close both statements inside the if.

But looking back at the original code, it has two }'s: one after a=1; and another after else. That's causing an error because the second } is closing something that shouldn't be closed yet.

So the fix is to remove the extra }, leaving only one at the end of the if block.

Therefore, I'll adjust the code by removing the last }, so it becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there are two closing braces `}` where only one is needed. The extra brace after `else` causes an unexpected end of statement.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
