Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, right away I notice that inside the if condition, there's a square bracket and some code inside it: [ a = 1; ]. Then after the else statement, there's another ] which seems to be causing the problem.

Wait, in JavaScript, when you have an if-else structure using square brackets for the body, each block needs its own closing bracket. So the initial if is written as if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ], but then the else statement ends with ] which probably closes the outer if's block incorrectly.

Let me think about how JavaScript structures this. Normally, you can write:

if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

Or using square brackets for short syntax:

if (condition) [ code ] else [ code ];

So in the given code, it's written as if (x > 0) [ a =1; ] else b=2; ]

The first part is correct: if condition followed by [ code ]. But then after else, there's another ], which might be closing the outer block instead of just the first part.

Wait, maybe the structure should be:

if (x>0)[a=1;]else[b=2;]

But in this case, both blocks inside the square brackets are correctly closed with their own ].

So perhaps the code was intended to have two separate statements inside the else, but it's incorrectly structured. Alternatively, maybe the user meant for the else block to only have b=2; and then close properly.

Wait, looking at the original code: after if (x>0)[a=1;], then else is followed by ] which would end the entire if statement, leaving nothing for the else clause.

So that's why there's an unexpected ] because the else doesn't have a body. So to fix this, we need to ensure each block has its own closing bracket.

Therefore, I should adjust it so both blocks inside square brackets are properly closed with their own ]s.

But wait, in JavaScript, you can also write:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Or using the short syntax without braces:

if (x>0)[a=1;]else[b=2;]

So that's correct. So the original code had an extra ] at the end, which wasn't needed.

Therefore, removing the last ] should fix it.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there are two closing brackets where only one is needed. The if statement and else clause each require their own bracket pair. By removing the final ], we properly close both blocks after using square brackets for code execution.

```fix
if (x > 0)[ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
