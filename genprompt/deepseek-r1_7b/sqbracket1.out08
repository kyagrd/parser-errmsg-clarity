Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

Looking at the code provided:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I see that there's an if statement with a condition `(x > 0)`. Inside the parentheses, which I assume are part of some block or maybe they're actually meant to be brackets for code blocks. Wait, no, in programming, if you want to create a block, you usually use curly braces `{}`, not square brackets `[]`.

So, looking at the line `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`, it seems like someone is trying to indent or format their code but used square brackets instead of curly braces. The `[` and `]` aren't recognized in an if statement context, so that's probably causing the error.

Then, after the else clause, there's another `]`. So the code ends with two closing brackets, which isn't correct because each block should have only one pair.

Let me break it down. The original code starts with `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The first part is an if statement checking if x is greater than zero. Inside that, someone tried to write `a = 1;` but used square brackets instead of curly braces. That's incorrect syntax because square brackets aren't valid in an if condition.

Next, the else clause comes in with `else b = 2;`, and then there's another closing bracket `]`. But since the first part already has `[ ]`, adding another one at the end is wrong because each block should only have one pair of curly braces or parentheses for conditions. So having two brackets causes a syntax error.

So to fix this, I need to change those square brackets to curly braces `{}` and remove the extra closing bracket at the end. Let me visualize that:

Original line: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`
After fixing:
- Change `[ a = 1; ]` to `{ a = 1; }`
- Remove the last `]` after the else clause.

So the corrected code should be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

I think that's it. Let me double-check: The if statement is correctly enclosed in curly braces, and the else part follows without any extra brackets. That should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
