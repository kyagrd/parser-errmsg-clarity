Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I see that the if statement is followed by some code using '@' and ';', then there's a comment starting with '#'. Then another '#' before the semicolon. Wait, in many programming languages like C or Python, you can't have a comment right after an else clause without something between them.

Looking at the error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So it seems that the parser is seeing the '#' as part of a new comment before the semicolon. But in this case, maybe it's causing confusion because there's no code between the comment and the next '#'.

I remember that comments can be inline, but if you have an else followed by another comment without proper syntax, it might confuse the parser. So perhaps adding a semicolon or some other operator before the '#' would fix it.

Alternatively, maybe I should combine the conditions into one statement to avoid using a multi-line approach with comments interfering.

Wait, in languages like C, for example, you can write else followed by code without needing an extra comment. But here, the code after if is already using @ and a semicolon, then there's another comment starting.

So maybe I should adjust it so that the comment comes after some valid code. Let me try adding a semicolon before the first '#' to make sure the parser doesn't get confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire else block can be written without the extra comment if possible. But since the original code had comments, maybe just moving the comment somewhere else or adjusting its placement would help.

Wait, but in C-like syntax, you can have else: with a colon, but here it's using @ which might not be part of an operator. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Another approach is to make sure that there's no comment immediately after the else. So maybe adding something before the # would fix it. But in this case, since the code is already ending with a semicolon and then another #, maybe just having one # at the end isn't correct because it might be considered a block comment.

Wait, perhaps combining everything into one line without splitting into two lines correctly could help avoid the syntax error. For example, using else: on the same line as the code would prevent this issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @a = 1; else@b = 2;
```
