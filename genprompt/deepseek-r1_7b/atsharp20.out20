Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code here with a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." Let me look at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, right off the bat, I notice that there are these '#' symbols at the end of each line. In programming languages like C or Java, those are comments. But wait, in some contexts, especially in certain scripts or if they're using different syntax, those might not be allowed where they shouldn't be.

The code starts with an if statement: if (x > 0) @ a = 1;. So the line is trying to execute something when x is greater than 0. Then there's another part: # else b = 2; which seems like it's a comment, but maybe that's causing issues.

I remember that in some languages or scripts, multiple statements on one line can be separated by semicolons. But here, the user mentioned that the syntax might be different from C, Java, Python, etc., so perhaps this is using an older style of code editing or a specific syntax where certain elements are handled differently.

Looking closer, the lines end with ';' but then there's a '#' after them. In many languages, semicolons terminate statements, and comments can come before that. But maybe in this case, those '#'s aren't supposed to be there at all.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps these are continuation lines. Sometimes in code, especially when using editors with line wrapping, people use '#' or other symbols to indicate that a statement continues on the next line. Maybe that's what's intended here.

So if I remove the '#' symbols, would that fix the syntax error? Let me try:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
else b = 2;

That looks better without the comments at the end of each line. The original code had those '#'s after the semicolons, which might not be valid in this context. Removing them would make each statement properly terminated with a semicolon and separated correctly.

Alternatively, if the intention was to have some kind of comment or continuation, but given that the error is just "syntax error," it's more likely that those '#'s are extraneous and causing issues by themselves at the end of lines where they shouldn't be.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax errors due to extra '#' symbols. Removing these will fix the issue.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
