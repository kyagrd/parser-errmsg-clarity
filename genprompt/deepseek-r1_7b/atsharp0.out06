Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it again.

The code is:
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I remember that in Python, you can't just put an operator like @ inside an if statement without some reason. Oh wait, maybe the user was trying to use a decorator or something with @, but it's not valid here.

Looking at the structure, after the if condition, there's an @a = 1; line. That doesn't make sense because in Python, assignments are done with =, and you can't have @ followed by an assignment like that. Also, the else part is on the same line as the @ statement, which isn't valid syntax.

So I think the problem is the placement of the @a line. It should be outside the if condition because decorators in Python go before function definitions, not inside conditionals. 

Let me try to rearrange it. Maybe the correct code would have the @a = 1; statement indented under the if block, and then the else part on a new line as well.

So the corrected code should look like:
if (x > 0):
    @a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Yes, that makes sense now. The @ operator is used with functions, so putting it inside an if statement without being before a function definition was causing the syntax error. By moving it inside the if block and aligning the else properly, the code should work.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    @a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
