Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that suggests there's an issue with the closing brackets somewhere.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I notice that after the if block, it uses 《 and 》 to wrap the assignment. Then, outside the if-else, there's another 》 at the end. That extra closing bracket is probably causing the error.

So, the code has a mismatched number of brackets. The inner else clause closes with 》, but then there's an extra one after the else statement. I should remove that extra 》 to fix it.

The corrected code should have only one set of brackets around each assignment. So, the if block is enclosed in 《 and 》, and similarly for the else block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
