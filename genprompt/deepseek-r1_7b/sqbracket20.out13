Thinking...
Okay, I need to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let's look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, so the error message is "syntax error". That means there's something wrong with the structure of the code.

First, I notice that after the if statement, there's an opening bracket [. Normally in programming languages like C or Java, brackets are used for arrays or conditional statements. Here, it looks like maybe someone tried to use a condition inside square brackets, but that's not standard syntax.

Wait, perhaps this is using a different syntax where conditions can be applied directly within the brackets. But I'm not sure about that. Let me check how if statements work in such contexts.

In some languages or frameworks, you might see something like (condition) ? value1 : value2; which is a ternary operator. Maybe the code was intended to use something similar here.

Looking at the structure: after the if condition, there's an else statement with b = 2;. So in between, the user has [ a = 1; ], but that doesn't make sense because it's inside the if block and not properly structured.

I think the issue is that instead of using braces { }, which are standard for enclosing blocks in many languages, someone used square brackets here. Also, the closing bracket ] is misplaced because there's no matching opening brace before it.

So to fix this, I should replace the [ with a { so that the block inside becomes part of an if-else structure properly enclosed by braces. Then, make sure the syntax for else is correct, which in many cases uses a colon and space: else ... 

Let me outline the steps:
1. Replace [ with { after if (x > 0) to correctly open the condition block.
2. Change the ] at the end to }, ensuring proper nesting of braces.

So the corrected code should look like this:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each block is properly enclosed within its own set of braces, and the syntax error should be resolved.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
