Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the code has a syntax error and gave an example where they have some angle brackets which might not be part of standard programming languages like Python or JavaScript. 

Looking at the code, it's written inside triple backquotes, which is a bit unusual. The original code looks like this:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, so I see angle brackets being used where maybe they shouldn't be. In Python, for example, we don't use angle brackets for anything standard. So perhaps these should be replaced with parentheses or other appropriate symbols.

First, the structure of an if-else statement in most languages is like this:

if (condition):
    do_something()
elif another_condition:
    do_another_something()

But here, I see that there are two separate conditions: one inside the first else block and another after it. Wait, no, looking again, the code has 'if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2;'. So maybe they intended to have an if-else structure where if x is greater than zero, set a to 1, else set b to 2.

But in their code, instead of using parentheses for the condition and proper indentation or newlines, they're trying to use these angle brackets. Also, I notice that there's a closing 》 after 'a=1;' but it seems misplaced because the if statement should have one opening and one closing bracket.

So let me break it down:

The original code is inside triple backticks, which might be just for display here. The actual code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

I think the problem is that they're using angle brackets where they should use parentheses because 'if' statements typically use parentheses around their conditions.

Also, there's an extra closing bracket at the end which doesn't belong. So perhaps replacing the angle brackets with regular parentheses and removing the extra one will fix it.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

Wait, but in their original code, they have 'a = 1;' without any semicolon? No, actually, looking again: 'a = 1; 》 else...' Wait no, it's more like:

if (x>0)《 a=1;》 else b=2;》

So the angle brackets are causing syntax errors because they're not recognized in this context. So replacing them with parentheses should fix it.

Moreover, there are two closing semicolons: one after 'a=1;' and another at the end, which is incorrect. In normal code, each statement ends with a semicolon or bracket.

Wait, looking again, perhaps the code was written as:

if (x > 0)《a = 1;》 else b = 2;

Which has two angle brackets in one if statement and another at the end without a matching opening. That would cause syntax errors because there's no closing for the last angle bracket.

So to fix this, I'll replace both angle brackets with parentheses, properly indent them, and remove any extra closing brackets.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

This way, each if-else block has its own condition in parentheses, and proper semicolons are used to terminate statements.
...done thinking.

The original code uses angle brackets instead of parentheses for the if statement conditions. Additionally, there's an extra closing bracket that needs removal. The fixed code replaces these with correct parentheses.

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

The corrected code is:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

So the final answer is:

```plaintext
if (x>0):a=1;else:b=2;
```
