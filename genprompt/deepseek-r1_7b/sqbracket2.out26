Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, so the code starts with an if statement. Normally, an if condition would have curly braces {} for block statements in some languages like JavaScript or Python. But here, I see square brackets [ and ]. Maybe this is part of another syntax.

Wait, looking closer, after the if condition, there's a [a = 1; ] followed by else b = 2; but then another ]. So it's something like:

if (x>0)[ a=1 ] else b=2;

I think the user might be using pseudocode or a different syntax where square brackets are used for arrays or lists. But in this case, the issue is with extra ']'.

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which implies that too many closing brackets were provided.

Looking at the code structure:

- The if condition starts with (x > 0) followed by a [ which might be part of array syntax.
- Then ] closes the bracket, but then the else statement and another ;, and another ] which is causing the error because it's an extra close brace after the else.

Wait, perhaps the code was intended to have two separate statements: one inside if and another in else. But they are both enclosed within square brackets, which might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But instead of using curly braces, they used [ and ], which is incorrect because those aren't recognized as block starters in this context.

So, replacing [ ] with { }, the code should fix the syntax. Let me see:

The original code has (x >0)[ a=1; ] else b=2;

If I replace [a=1;] with {a=1;} and the last ] with } then it would be correct.

Wait, but in the given code, after the if's condition comes [ a=1; ], which is 4 characters. Then else b=2; followed by another ]. So perhaps the structure was:

if (x>0)[a=1] else b=2;

Which has an extra ] at the end.

So to fix it, I should replace [ and ] with { }.

Let me try that: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That makes sense. The brackets were causing issues because they're not valid for this context.
...done thinking.

The code has an unexpected closing bracket after the `else` clause. By replacing the square brackets with curly braces, which are appropriate for block statements in this context, we fix the syntax error.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
