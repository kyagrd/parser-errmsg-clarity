Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code with a syntax error, and I need to fix it using only the information from the error message. The user provided the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And the error is "syntax error". Hmm, let me think about what's wrong here.

First, looking at the code structure, there are if and else statements with comments using #. The code has two lines: one inside the if block and another commented as else. But I'm not sure how these are structured in this context because it seems like maybe it's a mix of C-like syntax and something else.

Wait, I notice that after the if statement, there's an @ symbol before 'a = 1'. In some programming languages, @ is used for pointers or to denote side effects. But more importantly, in Python, for example, you can't use @ inside conditionals like that unless it's part of a decorator, which doesn't seem relevant here.

Looking at the first line: if (x > 0) @ a = 1;. That seems suspicious because after the if statement, there's an expression involving @. Maybe this is not valid syntax in whatever language the code is written in.

I remember that in C or similar languages, you can't have expressions like that inside conditionals unless they're part of the compound statement with braces, but here it's written without any braces. So perhaps the @ is causing a problem because it's an operator that needs to be applied somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the code is actually using a different syntax where @ is used for something else, like in shell scripts or some other contexts. But given the error is a syntax error, I think it's more likely related to how the expression is structured.

Looking at the second line: # else b = 2;. Since this starts with a comment, maybe that's being interpreted as an if-else block without proper braces. In many languages like C or Java, you need to wrap if-else statements in curly braces to avoid syntax issues when mixing comments and code lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the @ symbol is causing an issue because it's trying to execute something before the assignment happens. Maybe the correct way is to split the conditional into two separate lines without using the @ operator there.

Another thought: maybe the @ should be moved outside of the if condition so that it's a standalone statement. So instead of having @ inside the if, it should be on its own line with proper indentation or something else.

Wait, perhaps the code is intended to use an inline function or some other construct where @ isn't appropriate. Maybe it's supposed to assign 1 when x>0 and 2 otherwise without using @ at all.

Putting it together, I think the problem is that the @ is being used incorrectly inside the if condition. So the solution would be to remove the @ symbol from the first line so that the assignment happens after evaluating the condition.

So the corrected code would have two separate lines: one with the if statement and assignment, and another commented else clause without any operations attached because they might not be valid in their current form.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by the `@` operator being improperly used inside an `if` statement. Removing it allows proper syntax for assignment.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
