Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I notice there are some lines with `#` at the end. Maybe those are comments? But in Ruby, comments start with `#`. So perhaps they're trying to add comments but not correctly placed.

Wait, looking closely, after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there's a semicolon and then `@ a = 1;`, which is probably some code inside the condition. Then after that, it's followed by `# else b = 2; #`. So maybe they're trying to add an else block but didn't write it correctly.

But Ruby doesn't require indentation for else blocks like Python does. So perhaps the error is because of the way the comments are placed. The `#` after the if condition's semicolon might be causing a syntax issue because it's right after the closing parenthesis, making the parser confused about where the comment starts.

Also, the line has `@ a = 1;` which looks like a method call or something else, but it's part of an if statement. Maybe that's not intended here and is part of the problem.

I think the main issue is the placement of the comments. The code probably meant to have an else clause with some statements inside, but the `#` at the end is causing a syntax error because it's on the same line as the closing parenthesis.

So, to fix this, I should remove the incorrect comment or adjust where the comments are placed. But since they're not part of the actual code that needs executing, maybe just removing them would solve the problem.

Alternatively, if those lines were meant to be comments for the else clause, perhaps placing them on separate lines after the closing parenthesis without mixing with the semicolon would fix it.

Wait, looking at the error message again: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So maybe the parser is interpreting a `#` as part of an else block or something. It's trying to close the if statement but finds the `#` instead of some code.

So perhaps replacing those lines with proper Ruby syntax would help. Let me rewrite the code without the semicolons and comments after the closing parenthesis, because in Ruby, each statement is on its own line unless using ; for one-liners.

Wait, no, actually in Ruby, you can have multiple statements in a line separated by semicolons. So maybe the original code was trying to write:

if (x > 0) @a = 1; # else b=2; #

But that's not valid syntax because `@a = 1` is inside an if block and then another statement on the same line with a comment, which isn't correct.

So perhaps the intended code was to have:

if (x > 0)
  @a = 1;
else
  b = 2;
end

That makes more sense. So I'll adjust the code accordingly, removing the semicolons and placing else on its own line with proper indentation or using the same structure.

So putting it all together, the corrected code would have the if statement followed by the then block, then else, and then the end keyword without any trailing `#`.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to misplaced comments and semicolons. The comments were incorrectly placed after the closing parenthesis of the if statement. To fix this, remove those lines that contain `@a = 1;` and the following comments.

```ruby
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1;
else
  b = 2;
end
```

The fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) @a = 1;
else
  b = 2;
end
```
