Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, first off, I notice that there are some angle brackets being used where they shouldn't be. In most programming languages, angle brackets <> are not standard syntax unless it's specific to something like HTML or CSS. But here, the code seems to mix up curly braces {} and angle brackets.

Looking at the structure, the if statement should have an opening { after 'if', then a condition in parentheses. Then, when the condition is true, execute some code between the curly braces, which might be on multiple lines. After that, a closing } for the if block. If the else part exists, it's inside another set of curly braces.

So, in the given code, they're using 《 and 》 instead of { and }. Those are likely causing syntax errors because they're not recognized as opening or closing braces by the interpreter/compiler.

Another thing I notice is that after the if block, there's an else statement. But in this case, it looks like the else part isn't properly enclosed within curly braces either. The code has 'else b = 2;' followed by a closing }, which might not be correct because it would close the outermost block instead of the if-else structure.

Wait, let me count the brackets:

1. First, after (x>0), there's 《 ... 》, so that should be { and }.
2. Then, else b = 2; is outside these braces, which isn't correct because it would make the else part belong to an outer block or none at all.

So, I think the main issues are:

- Replacing 《 with {
- Replacing 》 with }
- Properly enclosing both if and else parts within their respective curly braces.

But looking closer, in Python, for example, you don't necessarily need to indent inside the if block unless it's multiple lines. But here, maybe they're trying to have the code on one line. However, using angle brackets where braces are needed is definitely a syntax error.

So, let me try to rewrite this step by step.

First, change 《 to { and 》 to }, so the structure becomes:

if (x >0) { a=1; } else b=2;

Wait, but that's all inside one line. That would make sense in some languages where single-line if-else is allowed. But maybe they wanted it properly indented or as multiple lines.

Alternatively, perhaps they intended to have each part within its own braces correctly.

So the correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, both if and else conditions are properly enclosed in their own curly braces. Also, this would fix the syntax error because now all statements inside the if and else are correctly within braces.

So putting it all together:

if (x >0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }
...done thinking.

The code has improperly used angle brackets instead of curly braces for both `if` and `else`. The corrected syntax uses curly braces `{}` to enclose the statements under each condition.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace 《 with {
2. Replace 》 with }
3. Properly enclose the if block in { ... }.
4. Enclose the else block within its own set of { ... }.

The fixed code is:

``` 
if (x >0) { a=1; } else { b=2; } 
```

But since there's an extra }, trimming it gives the final code as:

```fix
if (x>0){a=1; }else{b=2;}
```

Wait, actually, in Python and many other languages, you don't need a space after the closing brace. So another way is to write it without spaces.

But given the original code has no spaces after 《 and before 》, perhaps the same should be applied here.

So the final fixed code:

if (x>0){a=1;}else{b=2;}

Now, removing the extra backticks because they weren't necessary. The triple backtick was just for grouping, not syntax highlighting markers.

Final output:
```fix
if (x>0){a=1;}else{b=2;}
```
