Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an example where the code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And the error message is "syntax error". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

First, I notice that there are some odd characters: '@' and '#'. In programming languages like C or Java, these have specific meanings. For example, in C, '@' is used for defining pre-processor macros. But looking at the code structure, it seems like they're using an if statement followed by something else.

Wait, the code starts with 'if (x > 0) @ a = 1;'. So maybe the intention was to write two separate statements: one inside the if block and another in the else block. But how?

The line has '@' which might be causing an issue because it's not valid syntax on its own. Maybe it should just be 'a = 1;' instead of @ a = 1.

Also, after the if statement, there's '# else b = 2; #'. The '#' symbols are often used for comments in some languages like C or Ruby. So perhaps they're using these lines as comment blocks, but maybe not correctly placed.

Putting it together, I think the user wants to split the code into two separate statements: one inside the if block and another in the else. But due to the way it's written now, it's causing a syntax error because of the '@' and '#'.

So, removing the '@' might fix it. Let me try rewriting that line as 'if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }'. But wait, in many languages, you need to use braces for control structures unless they're single-line statements.

Alternatively, if this is meant to be in a language like C, then the code should have an opening and closing brace. So adding braces might fix it.

Wait, maybe the user isn't specifying the language, so I can only assume based on common syntax errors. The main issues are the '@' and '#' causing confusion between statements.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error because the `@` character is not valid in this context. Additionally, using `#` for comments might be interfering with how the code blocks are structured.

To fix it:
- Remove the `@` as it's not needed
- Ensure proper use of control structures (like braces `{}`)
  
The corrected code should be:

```fixer
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Here is the fixed code within triple backticks:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The code now defines an `if` statement where if `x > 0`, then `a` is set to `1`; otherwise, `b` is set to `2`.
