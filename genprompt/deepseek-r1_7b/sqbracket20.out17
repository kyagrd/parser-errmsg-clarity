Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax issue. Let me try to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I notice that after the `else`, there's an `]` which seems out of place. In many programming languages, square brackets are used for arrays or dictionaries, but here they might not be needed and could be causing a syntax error.

Also, looking at the structure: the if statement is followed by a block inside square brackets, then else without any block, ending with another `]`. This doesn't look right because each conditional branch should have its own block. 

Wait, in languages like JavaScript or PHP, you can use square brackets for arrow functions, but here it's part of an if-else statement. That seems incorrect.

So the main issues are:
1. The extra closing bracket `]` at the end is causing a syntax error because there's no matching opening bracket after the else.
2. The structure doesn't properly define separate blocks for each condition (if and else).

To fix this, I should consider removing the unnecessary square brackets around the if block. That way, the code will correctly have two separate blocks: one under if and another under else.

So the corrected code would be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

This removes the extra brackets, ensuring each condition has its own block, which should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
