Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code given. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error, and the code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, first, I notice that the code has some unusual characters like `@` and `#`. In typical programming languages such as C or Java, you might see something like an `else`, but here it's preceded by `@`. Also, the use of `#` at the end is confusing me. 

I remember that in some contexts, especially in shell scripting, the `if` statement doesn't work exactly like in other languages. Maybe this code is meant for a shell script? But even then, I'm not sure if `@` has any special meaning there.

Looking closer, the line ends with `# else b = 2; #`, which might be causing issues because each part of an if-else statement needs to end properly without extra characters. Also, in many languages, you can't mix statements and expressions like that unless it's a one-liner or something specific.

I think the main problem here is the use of `@` before `if`. In some shell scripting languages, I believe `@` is used for variables or command references, but not inside an if condition. So maybe replacing `@` with nothing would fix it.

So perhaps the corrected code should remove the `@` and just have the standard if-else structure. Let me see:

Original line: `(x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

If I remove the `@`, it becomes `(x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. But wait, this still ends with `#` at the end. Maybe those are extra and should be removed.

Alternatively, perhaps each condition is on its own line without the comments? Or maybe the code was meant to be a one-liner but has unnecessary comments or syntax mixed in.

Another angle: In some languages, like JavaScript, you can have single-line if statements, but here it's using `@` which I don't recognize. Maybe it's trying to pass an array with `@`, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, perhaps the code was intended for a different language where `@` is used as a keyword or operator. If so, maybe replacing it with something else like an assignment operator would fix it. But without knowing the exact language, it's tricky.

But looking at the error message again: "syntax error." That suggests that the syntax of the code doesn't follow the rules of whatever the interpreter is using. So perhaps `@` isn't a valid keyword there.

Putting it all together, I think the main issues are:

1. The use of `@` before `if`, which is invalid in many languages.
2. The trailing `#` after each statement, which might be causing syntax issues or being extra.

So the fix would involve removing the `@` and adjusting the comments or structure to conform to standard if-else syntax.

Therefore, I'll remove the `@` and also trim the trailing `#` from each line. The corrected code should look like:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

This way, it's a proper one-liner without extra characters causing syntax errors.
...done thinking.

The error in the code is due to the use of `@` before the condition and trailing `#` which aren't valid. Removing these fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Invalid Characters:** The code contains `@` and `#`, which are not part of standard if-else statements.
2. **Remove Invalid Characters:** Eliminate the `@` before `if` and remove trailing `#`.
3. **Correct Syntax:** Ensure each statement ends properly without extra characters.

The fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
