Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means a closing brace is missing somewhere. Let me look at the code again: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I notice that the if statement starts with opening braces and ends correctly with one }, but then the else part has its own block. Wait, no, actually, looking closely, after the else, there's another closing brace which might be causing the issue.

Wait, let me parse this line by line. The first line is an if condition: (x > 0) { a =1; } So that's correct—open curly, then some code, then close curly. Then the next line is else b=2; but before that, there's another closing brace '}' which probably belongs to the if statement.

Oh wait, no—the initial code ends with an extra closing brace after the else. Let me write it out:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b =2; }

So the first line is the if condition: {a=1;}, then }, which closes that block correctly. Then comes else, and inside its block? Wait no, because after else there's another ';', so maybe it's just else followed by b=2;, but without braces.

But wait, the error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So probably, somewhere an extra closing brace is present that doesn't match any opening brace. Let me check:

The code as given is: if (...) { a=1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first }, which closes the if block, then we have 'else' followed by some statements and another }. But wait, where does this second } come from? Because in an else statement, you can either use braces or not. If it's without braces, like else b=2;, that's acceptable because it doesn't require a block unless necessary.

But the error says unexpected '}' after else. That suggests that there's an extra } where it shouldn't be. So looking back at the code:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b = 2; }

Here, after the if condition and its block }, then else is written, but then there's another ';' followed by }. Wait no—wait, let me count the braces.

Wait, maybe it's better to write out each token. The code has:

- if (x >0) { a=1; } else b = 2; }

Breaking it down: 

if (x>0) { a=1; } — this is fine: opening brace after condition, then statements inside.

Then 'else' — that's the else keyword.

Then 'b=2;' — but wait, does that have to be inside braces? Well, if you don't use braces for the else block, it can only contain one statement. But in this case, b=2; is a single statement, so it's okay without braces.

But then there's an extra closing brace at the end: }, which doesn't match anything because after 'else' comes the code and that's all—so having another } would be incorrect.

Wait no, looking again:

The code as given ends with } else b =2; }

So perhaps it's structured like this: if (...} else ...}; That would mean an extra closing brace at the end of the entire statement. Because the else is part of the if structure, so any statements under else must be properly enclosed.

Wait no—another way to look at it: The code after the initial if block has } else b = 2; }, which means that there's a missing opening brace before 'else'.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write down the lines:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a=1; }

Line 2: } else b=2;

Line 3: }

So line 2 has an else statement with no braces, followed by b=2; then line 3 is another closing brace. So that's incorrect because the 'else' block should be properly enclosed.

Alternatively, maybe the initial code intended to have both if and else blocks with braces, but mistakenly added a } at the end where it shouldn't be.

Wait, looking again: 

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b =2; }

So after the else statement, there's another ';', then }, which is probably an extra closing brace that doesn't belong. So to fix this, perhaps we need to remove that extra } at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the code was meant to be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But in the given code, it's written as if (...) { ... } else b = 2; }, which is missing braces around the else part. But since 'else' can go without braces for single statements, but then you don't need an extra }.

Wait, no—if you have:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

That's correct because else doesn't require braces unless it has multiple statements or if you're using another block structure. So the error must be that there's an extra closing brace at the end of the code.

Looking back, the code as given is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after 'else', it has 'b=2;' and then another }, which is incorrect. So the last } is an extra one that shouldn't be there.

Wait no—because in the code as written, after 'else' comes ';}' — so perhaps the structure is:

if (...) { a=1; } else b=2;

But with an extra } at the end, making it if (...} else ...}; which would cause a syntax error because that closing brace doesn't match anything.

Wait no, in code, each opening brace must have a corresponding closing brace. So in this case:

- The first 'if' has an opening { and then inside is a=1; and another } — so that's correct.

Then after the if block, we have else b=2; }, which implies that there are two closing braces: one after if, and another at the end. But where would the second } belong? It doesn't match anything because 'else' ends there. So it's an extra brace.

So to fix this, I need to remove the last } so that the code becomes:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b =2;

But wait, in Python and JavaScript-like syntax, you can have else without braces for single-line statements. But in some contexts, perhaps it's causing an error because of the extra brace.

Wait no—the initial problem is that after 'else', there's another }, which doesn't belong. So to fix this, I need to remove the last } so that it becomes if (...) { ... } else b=2;

So the corrected code would be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b = 2;

But wait, in the given code, after 'else', there was ';}' — which is an extra closing brace. So to fix this, I need to remove that last }, so the code ends correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps adding braces around the else block if necessary. But since it's a single statement, it's optional.

So putting it all together, the correct code should have only one } at the end of the entire if-else statement.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there's an extra closing brace after the `else` statement. Removing this extra brace fixes the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Identify that the code ends with an extra closing brace.
2. Remove the last '}' to correct the syntax.

The fixed code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

```
