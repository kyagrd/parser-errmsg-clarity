Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let's see what the problem is. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that seems a bit tricky because I'm not entirely familiar with this specific programming language they're using. 

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice there are some special characters here: '《' and '》'. They look like Japanese punctuation, maybe used for comments or annotations in this context.

The error says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So perhaps the code is trying to close an if statement but isn't doing it correctly. Let me try breaking down the code.

The structure starts with an if condition: `if (x > 0)`. Then, inside that block, there's a line with `《 a = 1; 》`. It seems like this might be some kind of annotation or comment closing before assigning a value to 'a'. 

After the if block ends, the else clause is next: `else b = 2;` but then it has an extra '》' at the end. The error suggests that after the else, there's an unexpected character, so maybe this trailing '》' isn't needed.

Wait, in many programming languages, you don't need a closing brace for simple statements inside if blocks. So perhaps the `《 ... 》` is meant to close some kind of block before assigning a value, but it's causing confusion with the else statement.

Let me try removing that extra '》' at the end. The code would become:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
But I'm not sure if this makes sense syntactically. Without the final brace, does the else get correctly associated with the if condition? Maybe in some languages, but here it's causing an error.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a different style where after each statement inside the block, you close and reopen the block markers to annotate. So perhaps `《 ... 》` is used to wrap each line, including those outside of blocks. But that seems odd because else is at the same level as if.

I'm also thinking about whether there's an extra brace before else. Maybe it was supposed to be just one set around the if condition but not for everything inside. Or perhaps the extra '》' after else is causing a problem, so removing it might fix it.

So, putting it all together, I think the main issue is that there's an extra closing brace ('》') at the end of the code which doesn't belong. Removing it should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
