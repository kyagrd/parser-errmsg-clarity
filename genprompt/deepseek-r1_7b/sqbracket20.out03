Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I remember that in programming, if statements usually have an opening and closing brace or parenthesis for their body. In this case, it looks like someone used square brackets [ ] instead of curly braces { }, but the issue might be with the structure.

Wait, the code has a semicolon after the if condition: if (x > 0) [. Then there's a semicolon again inside the else statement: else b = 2; ]. But that doesn't make sense because each statement should end correctly. The problem is probably how the body of the if-else is structured.

I think in many programming languages, after the if condition and its corresponding opening bracket, you need to close it properly before the else starts. So maybe the square brackets are causing an issue here.

Let me break it down:

1. The code starts with an if statement: if (x > 0)
2. Then there's a semicolon, which is probably closing the condition incorrectly.
3. Inside what should be the else clause, there's another semicolon after else b = 2;
4. There's also a ] at the end, but it doesn't match with the opening [ before the if.

So the structure is messed up because the square brackets are not properly closed and opened. Instead of using square brackets for the if body, which isn't standard in many languages like JavaScript or Python, they should use curly braces { }.

Let me try rewriting it:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense. Now each block has its own opening and closing brace, and the code is properly structured without any syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
