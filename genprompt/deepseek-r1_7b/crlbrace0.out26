Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it closely. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I remember that in programming, each statement should end with a semicolon. So looking at the if statement, after "a = 1;" there's already a semicolon. That part seems fine.

Then there's an else statement: else b = 2;. Wait, but where is the opening brace for the else block? In this code, the else isn't followed by a {, so it's considered a single statement. But in reality, after 'else', we need to have a block of code inside curly braces.

So that's probably why there's a syntax error. The compiler or interpreter is expecting an opening brace for the else clause. Let me check: without the opening brace after 'else', it's invalid because each block must be enclosed in braces.

Therefore, I should add an opening brace after the else statement to properly enclose the subsequent line. So the corrected code would have an opening brace right after 'else'. That way, both the if and else cases have their own blocks of code.

Let me rewrite that part: else { b = 2; }. Now, does this make sense? Yes, because each condition's block is properly enclosed with braces now. The syntax error should be fixed.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error in the given code, we need to ensure proper use of braces for conditional statements.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue**: The original code lacks an opening curly brace `{` after the `else` keyword. This causes a syntax error because each block within an `if-else` statement must be enclosed in braces.
   
2. **Add Missing Brace**: Place an opening curly brace `{` immediately after the `else` keyword to correctly enclose the subsequent line of code.

3. **Ensure Proper Formatting**: Close the added brace with its corresponding closing curly brace `}` at the end of the else block to maintain correct syntax.

**Corrected Code:**

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The code now correctly uses braces for both conditional statements, resolving any potential syntax errors.
