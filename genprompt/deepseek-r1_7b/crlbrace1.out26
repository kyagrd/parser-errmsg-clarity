Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means a closing brace is missing somewhere. Let me look at the code again.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I see that there are two closing braces: one after the if statement and another at the end of the code. That's probably causing the error because C++ or similar languages expect only one brace for each block.

Wait, no. Let me count the braces correctly. The code starts with an if condition which has a single opening brace '{' and then inside it is 'a=1;'. Then there's an else clause without any opening brace, but in the original code, after that, there's another '}' before the final ';'.

So actually, the structure is:

if (...) { ... } else b = 2;

But because of the extra closing brace at the end, the parser gets confused. It expects only one closing brace for each block.

So I should remove the trailing brace so that it becomes:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, after the if-else statement, there's no extra brace, and the code compiles without errors.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by an extra closing brace. Removing one of them fixes the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
