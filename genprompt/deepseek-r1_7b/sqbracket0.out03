Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I know from the error message it's a syntax error, so something's wrong with the structure or the use of brackets here.

First, I notice the if statement is followed by square brackets. In programming, especially in languages like C++ or JavaScript, square brackets are used for array indexing or object literal notation. Using them after an if condition doesn't make sense because the code inside should be indented and separated properly within curly braces.

Looking closer, the line starts with (x > 0)[ a = 1; ]. That syntax is incorrect. I think it's trying to use an array or maybe a ternary operator, but that's not right here. The correct way would be to have { } around the statements inside the if condition.

Also, there are two closing brackets at the end: ] else b = 2; ]. Wait, no, actually, the code has [ after if and then another ] before else. That seems off. In an if statement, you should only have one opening brace and one closing brace, not multiple brackets.

So putting it all together, I think the correct approach is to replace the square brackets with curly braces. The structure should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}

But wait, in the original code, after if there's an opening bracket and then inside it's another closing bracket before else. So the actual issue is that square brackets are being used instead of curly braces.

So to fix this, I'll change both [ and ] to { } where necessary. That way, each condition block has its own properly opened and closed braces.
...done thinking.

The code contains syntax errors due to incorrect use of square brackets in place of curly braces. The fixed version uses proper curly braces for the if-else structure.

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replaced `[` and `]` with `{ }` after the `if` statement to properly enclose the block.
2. Added an additional `{ }` around the code in the `else` clause for correct syntax.
3. Removed unnecessary square brackets entirely as they are not required here.

The fixed code now correctly uses curly braces which are standard for enclosing if-else blocks in most programming languages, ensuring proper scoping and avoiding syntax errors.
