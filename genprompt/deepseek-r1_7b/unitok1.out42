Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay, I see that inside the if statement, there are angle brackets '《' and '》'. Those aren't valid in normal JavaScript. Similarly, after the else clause, there's another pair of angle brackets which probably isn't intended.

Wait, maybe those were supposed to be something like parentheses or brackets? But looking closer, I think the problem is that these characters are used where they shouldn't be. The user mentioned an error message about '》' being unexpected after the else clause, which suggests there's a missing matching character.

So perhaps the 《 and 》 should not be there at all. Let me try removing them to see if the code becomes valid. If I take out the angle brackets from both parts, the code would look like this:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

That makes more sense. The semicolons are correctly placed now without any extra brackets. Also, removing the angle brackets eliminates the syntax error mentioned.

I should check if there's another way to use those characters, but given the context and the error message, it seems they were misplaced or unnecessary. So, the fixed code should just have a simple if-else statement without using angle brackets.
...done thinking.

The original code has syntax errors due to unexpected angle brackets `《` and `》`. Removing these incorrect characters fixes the issue.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
