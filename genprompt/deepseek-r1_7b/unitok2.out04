Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this code based on the given error message. The user provided a code snippet with an unexpected '》' after the else clause. So, first, I'll look at the code they have:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, there's something wrong here. The error message mentions an unexpected '》' after the else clause. I remember that in many programming languages, after an if-else block, you don't need to close it with another parenthesis or bracket unless it's part of a larger structure.

Looking at the code, the if statement starts with (x > 0) and has two lines inside: one for the else condition and another for when x is greater than zero. But then there are these brackets '《' and '》' which seem to be causing issues.

I think the problem is that they're using '《' and '》' instead of regular parentheses or brackets. In some languages, you might use different symbols, but here it looks like they should just be using standard braces { } because in if-else statements, those are more appropriate.

So, replacing the 《 with { and the first 》 with }, we get:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Wait, but looking at their code again, they have two closing brackets after else. Let me check: in the original code, it's `》 else b=2; 》`. Oh, right, so there are two closing brackets. So I should also remove that extra one.

Putting it all together, I'll change 《 to { and } for both ends of the if-else block, removing any extra brackets at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
