Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

First, I notice that the else statement is followed by 'b=2;' without an if condition. That doesn't make sense because in most programming languages like C or Java, each else must correspond to an if inside the same block.

So, probably, the code was meant to have an else if (x <=0) { b=2; } instead of just else b=2;. But looking at the structure, maybe they intended for both cases to assign a value. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be a single condition with multiple assignments inside.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the code is in a language where statements can end with semicolons, but here the if statement starts and has an else that's improperly closed. Let me check the braces. The opening brace after the if is there, but then the else doesn't have its own block, so it's attached to the same level as the if, which isn't correct.

Looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So, the structure is: if condition { statement } else statement;

But in most languages, the else must have its own block. So the error is that the else doesn't have an opening brace.

Wait, but looking at it again, after 'else', there's no opening brace before assigning b=2. That would cause a syntax error because you can't end the if statement prematurely without closing braces properly.

So the correct fix would be to add an opening brace for the else part and adjust the structure so that each condition has its own block.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to assign 1 when x>0 and 2 otherwise. So perhaps both cases should have their own blocks inside if-else statements.

Wait, another angle: If this is a language where you can write multiple statements on the same line, but I don't think so because of the syntax error.

Alternatively, maybe it's using JavaScript-like syntax with block structures. Let me consider that possibility.

In JavaScript or similar:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That would be correct. So in the given code, after 'else', there should be an opening brace before assigning b=2; and then a closing brace.

Looking back at the original code: The else is followed by b=2;, without braces. That's incorrect because else needs its own block.

So to fix it, I need to add { after else and close both blocks properly.

Wait, but in the given code, the if starts with an opening brace, then inside has a statement, then } else... So maybe the structure is:

if (...) {
    a=1;
} else b=2; }

But without braces for else. That's invalid because the else needs its own block.

So the correct fix would be to add { after else and close both blocks correctly.

Wait, but looking at the code again, the if has only one statement inside, then else assigns a value outside of any block. So that's incorrect.

Another thought: Maybe it's using a language where semicolons are used differently, like maybe it's a typo or shorthand syntax somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code is intended to assign 1 when x>0 and 2 otherwise without braces, but in most languages, you can't do that because else must be paired with an if statement within braces.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps this is using the ternary operator, which has a different syntax. But the code uses if-else so it's unlikely.

So to sum up, the error is likely due to missing braces after 'else'. So I'll need to add { after else and close both blocks properly.
...done thinking.

The original code has an `else` statement without an opening brace, causing a syntax error. The fix involves adding an opening brace for the `else` block.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Step-by-step explanation:

- Added `{` after `else`.
- Properly closed both blocks by adding `}` after `b=2`.

The corrected code now properly structures the if-else statement with each block enclosed in braces.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else {
    b = 2;
}
```
