Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means a closing brace is missing or misplaced. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I see that the if statement starts with "if (x > 0) {" and then inside, there's "a = 1;" followed by an else without any condition. Oh wait, no, in this code, after the if block closes with }, it has an else b=2; which is outside the if's scope. But looking at the code structure, maybe the braces aren't properly closed.

Wait, let me count the braces. The first line inside the code starts with { and then a = 1;, so that's one {. Then after the if statement, there's an else followed by b=2; }, which is another brace. So the structure would be:

if (condition) { ... } else {...}

But in this case, maybe the else part isn't properly closed or matched with the initial if.

Wait no, looking again: The code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first }, it has an else statement which starts but then ends with another }. So perhaps there's only one closing brace at the end. But in reality, each if-else clause should have its own braces.

Wait, maybe the code is like this:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a=1; }

Then line 2: } else b=2;

But wait, that can't be right because after the first }, it's trying to close another block. Oh no, perhaps the structure is incorrect.

Wait, in many programming languages, each if statement must have its own braces, so an else should directly follow without any new block unless nested. But looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

So after the first }, which ends the if's block, there is an else with another }. Wait, but in this case, maybe the else isn't properly part of the initial if.

Wait no, because the else should be at the same level as the if. So perhaps the code is trying to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But it's missing a brace after the else.

Looking at the original code again: The first line has an if with a block ending with }, then 'else' followed by b=2 and another }. So perhaps that's incorrect because there's only one closing brace for the entire structure, which might not be intended.

Wait no, in reality, each statement inside an if-else must have its own braces. So maybe the code is trying to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But without the second }, so it's missing. Alternatively, perhaps there are two closing braces which isn't valid.

Wait, let me parse this step by step. The original code has:

Line 1: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } 

Then line 2: else b=2;

And then another } at the end: }

So when looking for matching braces, the first if's block ends with }, but then after that, there's an else which expects to be inside the same if statement. But in this code, after the first }, it's trying to place else outside of any block because there are no braces wrapping the else. Therefore, the else is part of nothing and then another } closes a brace that doesn't exist.

So maybe the correct structure should have each condition with its own braces:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

But in this case, the code has an extra }, making it invalid. So to fix this, I need to add another } after the else part so that all blocks are properly closed.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code is trying to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But without braces around the else's statement, which would make it invalid because in many languages, the else must be followed by a block. So adding a brace after the else would fix it.

So the corrected code should have an extra }, making it:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Or perhaps with only one } at the end if both statements are in their own blocks.

Wait, but looking back at the error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)" suggests that there's a brace too early or not enough. So maybe the code is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But then it ends with another }, which doesn't match.

So in this case, perhaps the correct structure is to have each if-else block within its own braces, so that's why we need an extra } at the end. So adding another } after 'else' would fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a missing closing brace for the else statement. We need to add an additional `}` to properly close both the if and else blocks.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
