Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's a syntax error, and the code provided is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, let me look at this carefully. 

First, I know that in an if-else statement in programming languages like C or Java, each block inside the braces needs to be properly indented and closed correctly. So looking at the code, after the if condition, there's a block with { a = 1; }, which is correct because it has a semicolon at the end. Then comes the else part without an opening brace, but wait, no, let me check again.

Wait, the code after else is b = 2; followed by a closing brace and then another semicolon outside? Let me parse this correctly.

The original code seems to be written as:

if (x > 0) { 
   a = 1;
} else
   b = 2;
}

But in the given code, it's presented without spaces for readability, which might make it hard to spot. The actual code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that after the if block, there's an else statement but no opening brace. Wait, in programming languages like C or Java, each control structure needs braces for the entire block. So if you have an else without matching braces, it might cause issues.

Wait, let me count the braces. The code starts with {, then inside is a=1;, then } else b=2; }, which closes another brace incorrectly.

Ah, I think the issue is that after the else statement, there's no opening brace before writing b = 2;. So the code as written would have two closing braces at the end: one after a=1; and another at the very end. That might not make sense because it could close more blocks than necessary.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how if-else statements should look. The correct structure is:

if (condition) { 
   // code
} else {
   // code
}

So in the given code, after the first }, which ends the if block, there's an else without any opening brace before it. So that's a syntax error because the else needs to be part of a block.

Therefore, I need to add an opening brace for the else block and close both blocks properly. Let me adjust that.

The corrected code should look like:

if (x > 0) { 
   a = 1;
} else {
   b = 2;
}

Wait, but in the original code, it's written without spaces around keywords. So I'll remove those spaces to make it consistent with how C or Java requires.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}

But wait, that might not have a space after 'if' and before '('... Oh, actually, in some languages, you don't need spaces around keywords unless for readability. But to fix the syntax error, perhaps adding braces correctly is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the code was intended to be written without spaces, so I should just ensure that each block has its own braces.

So putting it all together, the correct fixed code would have an opening brace after else and remove the extra closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The original code had a syntax error because the `else` statement didn't match with its corresponding block. By adding an opening brace for the else part and removing the extraneous closing brace, the code becomes syntactically correct.

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}
```
