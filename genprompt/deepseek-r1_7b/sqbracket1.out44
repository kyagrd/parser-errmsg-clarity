Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me take a look at it. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, from the error message, it says "unexpected ']' after else clause." So there's an extra closing bracket somewhere.

I know that in JavaScript, when you have a block of statements inside an if or else condition, you use curly braces {}. In this code, I see square brackets instead. That might be part of the problem because square brackets are used for arrays or objects, not for blocks in control structures like if-else.

Looking at the structure, it seems like the user tried to write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But instead, they wrote [a = 1; ] which is incorrect. So I need to replace those square brackets with curly braces.

So the corrected code should be replacing [ and ] with { and }. Let me rewrite that part:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but there's also an extra closing bracket at the end. The original code ends with ]; ], so after fixing, it should only have ); because once we replace [ ] with {}, we don't need the extra ].

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect use of square brackets instead of curly braces for block definitions. Replacing `[` with `{` and `]` with `}` will fix the syntax error.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
