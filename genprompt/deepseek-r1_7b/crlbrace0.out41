Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me a syntax error. Let me look at it closely. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Hmm, I remember that in an if-else statement, both branches need to be properly enclosed within the curly braces. So after the if block, there's an else followed by b=2;. But it seems like the else isn't part of the if condition correctly.

Wait, maybe the problem is with how the code is structured. The code ends abruptly with a semicolon and then another } without matching it properly. Let me count the braces. Oh right, after the if statement's closing brace at the end of the first line inside the curly braces, there should be an else block starting with its own braces.

So actually, the correct structure should have both branches enclosed within their respective braces. The original code only has one opening brace for the if condition but two closing braces, which is incorrect because it doesn't properly close everything.

I think the fix is to add another opening brace after the first else statement so that each branch of the if-else is correctly enclosed in its own set of braces. That way, the syntax error should be resolved.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to improper use of curly braces in an `if-else` structure. The `else` block isn't properly closed and doesn't have its own opening brace.

**Step-by-step explanation:**
1. The original code uses only one `{` for the if statement but ends with two `}`, which is incorrect.
2. Each `if` or `else` clause needs to be enclosed within its own set of curly braces.
3. By adding another `{` after `else`, each branch gets its own opening brace, resolving the syntax error.

The fixed code should look like this:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
