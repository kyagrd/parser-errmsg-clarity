Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, let me look at it carefully. First, I know that in programming, especially in languages like JavaScript or Python, the if statement has to have proper indentation and structure. Here, the if condition ends with a closing parenthesis.

Wait, looking closer, after the if block, there's an else statement, but how is it structured? The code inside the if is [ a = 1; ] which seems odd because usually, you don't put spaces in variable assignments like that. Also, I notice square brackets around 'a = 1;'—maybe that's causing an issue.

So, the syntax error could be due to the use of square brackets where they're not expected. In JavaScript, for example, when using template literals or arrays, you use square brackets. But in this context, it might be incorrect because after the if statement, we should have a single expression or block inside.

Another thing is that the else statement isn't properly connected to the if. It looks like there's an extra ] at the end which might close something incorrectly. So perhaps the structure is wrong.

Let me try breaking it down. The correct syntax for an if-else statement in JavaScript is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But here, instead of using curly braces, they're using square brackets and semicolons, which isn't standard. Square brackets are used for arrays or objects. So that's probably where the error is.

So to fix this, I should replace the square brackets with curly braces. Also, ensure that each statement inside the if and else blocks is properly indented and follows the correct syntax.

Let me rewrite it step by step. The corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each block has its own curly braces, and the statements inside are correctly placed. Also, using proper indentation makes the code more readable.

I think that's it. The main issues were the use of square brackets instead of curly braces and ensuring that each statement is properly enclosed within the blocks.
...done thinking.

The syntax error arises because square brackets are used where they shouldn't be in an if-else structure. We need to replace them with curly braces `{}`.

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
