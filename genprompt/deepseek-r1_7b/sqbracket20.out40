Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this code based on the error message provided. The user mentioned a syntax error in their code snippet, and they want me to fix it using only the information from the error message, without relying on any pre-existing knowledge about specific programming languages like C or Java.

Looking at the code given:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, first off, I notice that there are square brackets around the if condition. In many programming languages, square brackets aren't used for control structures like if statements. Instead, parentheses or other constructs are typically used.

The code starts with `if (x > 0) [`, which seems odd because it's using square brackets where a parenthesis should be. I'm thinking maybe they meant to use parentheses instead of the brackets here. So replacing `[` with `(` and `]` with `)` could fix that part.

Next, looking at the code inside the if block: `a = 1;`. That looks fine, but let me check the else statement. The else is followed by `b = 2; ]`, which again has a square bracket instead of a parenthesis. So I should change those as well to remove the brackets.

Putting it all together, replacing both sets of square brackets with parentheses should fix the syntax error because it's expecting if-else statements to be enclosed within round parentheses in most languages. This would make the code look more standard and syntactically correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
