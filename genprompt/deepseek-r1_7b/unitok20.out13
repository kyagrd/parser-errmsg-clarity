Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code first: 

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I remember that in many programming languages like C or Java, we use curly braces {} for blocks. Maybe this is a similar syntax. The error message says "syntax error," so something's wrong with how the code is structured.

Looking at the if statement, it has an opening parenthesis and then some code inside. After that, there's an else clause. But looking closely, I see 《 and 》 around 'a = 1;' and another pair around 'b = 2;'. Those look like angle brackets or some kind of syntax used instead of curly braces.

Wait, maybe the code is using a different syntax where blocks are defined with specific symbols. The user mentioned that it could be similar to C, Java, etc., so perhaps they're using curly braces. So I should replace those 《 and 》 with { and } for the if block.

So the corrected line would be: if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

But then, what about the else part? In standard syntax, after an if-else statement, it's usually on the same line. But in this case, maybe it's written as else b = 2; and then another } at the end.

Wait, looking again: the code has 'if (x>0)《a=1;》else b=2;》'. So perhaps after the if block, there should be an else clause without a new line. Let me try to structure it correctly.

So putting it all together, I think the correct code should have the if statement with curly braces, and then the else part on the same line but properly indented or aligned.

Wait, maybe the 'else' is attached to the if block's closing brace. So after }, the next line would be the else clause.

Alternatively, perhaps it's written in a way that doesn't require a new line for else. Let me try structuring it without any extra lines:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That seems correct. So I should replace the angle brackets with curly braces and adjust the structure accordingly.

So the fixed code would be: if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

Yes, that makes sense. The syntax error was because it was using incorrect block delimiters.
...done thinking.

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;
