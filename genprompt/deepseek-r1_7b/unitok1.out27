Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out what's wrong with this code. The user mentioned a syntax error where there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Hmm, I remember that in JavaScript, we use curly braces {} for blocks, not these symbols 《 and 》. 

Looking at the code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }. Wait, so there are extra curly braces here. The original code has { after if and then another } after else. That's probably causing the issue because JavaScript expects only one pair of braces per block.

So, I think the problem is that the user used incorrect syntax with these symbols instead of regular curly braces. They should replace 《 with { and 》 with }. 

Let me correct it step by step. The corrected code inside the backticks would be:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
That way, each block has its own braces without any extra characters causing errors.
...done thinking.

The error is due to using '《' and '》' instead of regular curly braces `{}`. Here's the fixed code:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
