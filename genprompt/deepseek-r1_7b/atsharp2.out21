Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code snippet provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The user mentioned there's a syntax error related to an unexpected '#' after the else clause in an if statement that's already closed. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out what's wrong with this code.

I notice that after the else keyword, there's a comment using '#', but comments aren't valid inside code blocks unless they're properly indented or placed correctly. But looking at the structure, the 'else' is part of an if statement, so it shouldn't have any following lines except for the else block.

Wait, in some languages like C or Java, you can use 'else' on the same line as the if without needing a semicolon and then another line. Maybe that's what's happening here. Let me check the code again.

The code is written with an if condition followed by @a = 1; Then there's a # else b = 2; which seems like it's trying to add an else clause but misplaced because of the comment syntax.

I think in this context, the user might be using a language where you can write the else part immediately after the if without a new line. So perhaps the code should look more like:

if (x > 0) @a = 1; 
else @b = 2;

But wait, there are two semicolons at the end which seems odd. Maybe they're meant to end statements but not applicable here.

So the main issue is that after else, it's trying to add a comment which isn't allowed in this context. Instead, the code should structure the if-else without any unnecessary comments or extra lines beyond what's needed for the else block.

I'll adjust the code by removing the # else line and properly indenting the else part. Also, I'll remove the trailing semicolons since they might not be necessary here.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @a = 1; else @b = 2;
```
