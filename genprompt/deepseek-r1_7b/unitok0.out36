Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message which is just "syntax error", so that's all I have to go on without using any pre-trained knowledge. Let me look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, looking at this line by line, it seems like there's some issue with how the comments are structured. I know that in C/C++, we use `/* */` for multi-line comments. The code uses 《 and 》 which might be a way to represent them here, but maybe they're not correctly placed.

First, let me check where the brackets are. In the if statement, after the condition, there's an opening parenthesis, then some code inside, followed by else. But looking at the code:

The line starts with `if (x > 0)`, which is fine. Then it has `《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. So the first part is supposed to be a comment? The user's code might have intended to use comments but messed up the syntax.

Wait, in C/C++, you can't have a semi-colon inside an if statement unless it's a single-statement condition. Here, they're using `《` and `》` which are probably meant as comments. So maybe they forgot to close the comment properly or there's an extra one at the end.

Looking closer, after the closing parenthesis of the if statement, there's an opening 《 before `a=1;`. That should be a single-line comment starting with `/*`, but here it's using 《 which is likely not recognized as a comment delimiter. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to use HTML entities or something else.

Wait, in some code blocks, people use different delimiters for comments. So perhaps the user intended to write:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

So replacing the 《 and 》 with proper curly braces { and }, but in the code they have extra ones at the end.

Wait, looking again: The original code has:

`if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`

I think there are two closing brackets. One after `a=1;` and another at the end. That's probably causing a syntax error because it's not properly closed.

So to fix this, I need to remove the extra comment markers. So replacing the 《 with { and } where appropriate, but also removing any trailing ones that aren't needed.

Alternatively, maybe they intended to use C++ comments by using `//` or `/* ... */`, but it's unclear. Given the code uses 《 and 》, perhaps those are placeholders for `{}` in this context.

Wait, another thought: In some code formatting tools or editors, people might write comments with different symbols like 《 and 》 as delimiters. So maybe they intended to use those instead of curly braces but forgot that in C/C++ the `{` must be on a new line inside an if statement unless it's a single-statement condition.

Wait, looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after `x>0`, there's a comment opening 《, then the code a=1; and closing 》. Then outside that, they have else b=2; followed by another }.

Wait no, actually, it's:

if (x > 0) [comment starts] a =1; [comment ends] else b=2;

But in reality, if you try to put code inside an if condition where the condition is on one line and the body is split into multiple lines with braces. So maybe they intended to write:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

So perhaps replacing 《 and 》 with { }, but also removing any trailing ones.

Alternatively, since in C/C++ you can have comments starting with // for single-line or /* */ for multi-line. So maybe the user intended to write:

if (x>0) // a =1; else b=2;

But that would be adding a comment after the if statement, which isn't correct syntax.

Wait no, in code, you can't have an if followed by a single semicolon with comments like that. The correct way is either to use braces or proper indentation for the body.

I think the main issue here is incorrect placement of brackets and missing braces. So probably, they intended to use `{}` but made a typo or mistake in syntax.

Alternatively, maybe they used Chinese punctuation marks by mistake because 《 and 》 are similar to English parentheses. But that's more about formatting than syntax.

But since we can't change the characters except fixing the syntax, perhaps replacing 《 with { and } appropriately.

Wait, let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after if (x>0), they have `《 a=1; 》` which is probably intended to be a block comment. Then outside, there's another } at the end.

But in C/C++, each opening brace must have a corresponding closing brace, and same for comments. So perhaps the original code has an extra comment that should not be there.

Alternatively, maybe they used 《 as an opening of a block comment but forgot to close it properly.

Wait, I think the main issue is that after `x>0`, they're trying to insert some code inside with comments but messed up the structure. So perhaps replacing those 《 and 》 with { } so that:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That would fix it.

So in the original code, after `if (x>0)` they have an opening comment which is causing syntax issues. So replacing those with curly braces should fix it.
...done thinking.

The code has misplaced and extra comment markers. Replacing them with proper curly braces fixes the syntax error.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The fixed code is:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
