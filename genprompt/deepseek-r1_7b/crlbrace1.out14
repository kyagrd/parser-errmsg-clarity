Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message is "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code provided.

The code is:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I see that there's an if statement with a condition and then an else clause. The problem is probably with the braces. Let me count them.

Starting from the top, after `if (x > 0)`, there's `{ a = 1; }`. That looks correct—each opening brace has a corresponding closing brace. Then it goes to the else part: `else b = 2; }`.

Wait, so after the if block ends with `}`, and then comes the else statement which also ends with `}`. But that would cause an extra closing brace at the end of the code.

Looking back at the error message, it says "unexpected '}' after else clause", so there's a surplus of braces here. The original code has two sets of braces: one for the if block and another for the else statement, but it should only have one set because both branches are part of the same condition.

So the correct structure should be:
- if (condition) { ... }
- else { ... }

But in the given code, the else is followed by `b = 2; }`, which is missing the opening brace. That's why there's an extra '}' causing a syntax error.

Wait no, actually looking closer: after `else b = 2;` comes another `}`. So it should be like:
if (x >0) { ... }
else { ... }

But in the original code, the else is followed by `b=2; }`, so adding an opening brace before that would fix it.

So I need to add `{` after `else` and before `b=2;`. That way, the braces are balanced correctly. Also, remove the extra closing brace at the end.

Let me adjust the code accordingly:
- Change from `else b = 2; }` to `else { b = 2; }`.

Yes, that should fix it because now each block has its own braces properly.
...done thinking.

The code has unbalanced braces after the else statement. By adding an opening brace `{` right after `else`, we correctly associate it with the subsequent assignment.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
