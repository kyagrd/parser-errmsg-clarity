Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me see what's going on here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I notice that there are two closing braces. The if statement is properly closed with one '}', but then after the else clause, there's another '}'. Wait, does that make sense?

The structure should be: if block, else block. Each block is within curly braces. So the correct structure would have each condition followed by its own braces.

Let me write it out step by step. The if statement checks if x > 0. If true, a is assigned 1 and closed with one '}'. Then the else part should also be inside braces to handle the case when x <= 0. So b = 2 should be within another set of braces.

So the corrected code would have each block in its own curly braces:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but in the original code, after the else there's another '}' which is unnecessary. That's why the error occurred—there are two closing braces where only one should be needed.

So putting it all together, I need to remove the extra brace at the end and make sure each statement inside if and else has its own braces.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace after the `else` clause. We should fix this by removing the extra brace so that each block (if and else) is properly enclosed.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The original code has two closing braces, which is incorrect.
2. The `else` clause should be followed by its own block in curly braces `{}`.
3. Remove the extra closing brace at the end to fix the syntax error.

The corrected code properly structures each if-else block with their respective braces.
