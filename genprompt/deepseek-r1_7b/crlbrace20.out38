Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error is a syntax error, so something's wrong with the code structure or declaration.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, the if statement seems incomplete. After the else clause, there's no corresponding opening brace for the initial if block. So the code is missing an opening curly brace before 'else'.

The correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, I also notice that in the original code, after the first closing brace of the if statement, there's another closing brace for the else. That would mean two closing braces without an opening one between them, which is incorrect.

So, adding the missing opening brace before the else should fix it. Let me adjust that.
...done thinking.

The syntax error occurs because there's a missing opening curly brace after the first block of code inside the `if` statement, causing the `else` to be incorrectly associated without its corresponding block. 

Here is the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
