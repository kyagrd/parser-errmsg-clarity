Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code provided is:

```plaintext
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Alright, so I notice that there are these angle brackets '《' and '》' around the statements. Wait, in programming languages like Python or JavaScript, we usually use parentheses () for function calls or conditionals, not angle brackets. So maybe those characters here are causing an issue.

The error message points out an unexpected '》'. That suggests that after the else clause, there's an extra '》' which doesn't belong. Let me think about how the code should look without these angle brackets. The original structure is:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

But in the provided code, they replaced each colon with these angle brackets and semicolons inside them.

So I should probably replace those '《' and '》' back to regular parentheses. Let me rewrite it step by step.

First, remove the extra spaces after the if and else keywords because that's not standard syntax either. So instead of "if (x > 0) 《", it should be "if (x > 0):".

Similarly, for the else part: "else b = 2;" without the angle brackets.

Putting it all together:

```plaintext
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript, you can have semicolons at the end of each statement inside the block. So that part should be fine as long as each line is correctly placed within the if or else clause.

I also notice there's an extra closing parenthesis after the else; that shouldn't be there. So removing that '》' will fix it.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should have proper parentheses and correct indentation without the angle brackets.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because the code uses angle brackets (《》) instead of regular parentheses for if-else statements. These characters are not recognized in standard programming syntax. To fix this, replace the angle brackets with parentheses.

```plaintext
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
