Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code based solely on the error message provided. The error is an unexpected '}' after else clause, which means there's a mismatched brace somewhere. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, so the structure has an if statement with braces and an else block. The first part is correct: the if condition ends with }, which closes the if block correctly. Then there's an else followed by another brace, but when I look at the lines after that, it seems like the code might be incomplete or mismatched.

Wait, in the original code, after the else statement, there's a semicolon and then another } before the closing of the outer braces. That doesn't make sense because each if-else should have its own blocks. Let me try to parse this step by step.

The first part is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

That looks correct, with the opening and closing braces matching. Then comes:
} else b = 2; }

Oh, wait! After the if block closes with }, it immediately starts an else statement. But in most programming languages, you can't just have 'else' right after the if's closing brace without a corresponding if block. So that's probably where the error is.

Looking at the code again: The structure is if (...) { ... } else ... }, which suggests that the else is attached to the first if statement incorrectly. This might be treating the else as part of an outer scope, but more likely, it's causing a syntax issue because there are two closing braces in a row before 'else'.

Wait, no, looking again: The code has:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first if block closes with }, then we have an else statement. But the way it's written might be causing the parser to think that the else is part of some other structure, leading to the unexpected brace error.

Alternatively, maybe the code intended to write separate if-else blocks but didn't format correctly. Perhaps the original code was meant to have each condition in its own block without nesting. Let me try reformatting it properly.

The correct way would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each statement is enclosed within its own braces, and the structure is correctly formatted. In the original code, after the first } from the if block, there's an else which might have been intended to be part of another block but wasn't properly closed or opened.

So the fix involves adding curly braces around both the if and else parts so that each has its own block without any syntax errors.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because the code incorrectly closes the `if` block before starting the `else`. By adding braces for both the `if` and `else` statements, we fix the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
