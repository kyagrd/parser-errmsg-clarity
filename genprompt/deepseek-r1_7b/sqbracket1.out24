Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means the if statement has already been closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I see that inside the parentheses of the if condition, there's "[ a = 1; ]". Wait, in JavaScript, square brackets are used for creating arrays or defining block scopes. But here, it's placed after the condition without being part of any control structure.

So maybe this code is mistakenly using square brackets where they shouldn't be. The else statement follows immediately after the if block, so adding a semicolon right after ] makes sense to close the else clause. However, I'm not sure why there's an extra ] at the end.

Looking closer, the original code has "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". The last ] is probably causing the syntax error because it's closing something that wasn't opened. Since the if condition doesn't require any block after the parenthesis unless using curly braces or a different structure, adding an unnecessary array here is wrong.

I think the correct approach is to remove the square brackets and semicolon inside them so that the code becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But wait, in JavaScript, you can write it without curly braces as well. So another way is just:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

This makes the code cleaner and avoids the syntax error. So I'll adjust the original code by removing the extra ] at the end and fixing any misplaced brackets.
...done thinking.

The code has an unexpected closing bracket after `else`, which suggests the if statement was improperly closed. The fix is to remove the unnecessary square brackets.

Here's the corrected code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
