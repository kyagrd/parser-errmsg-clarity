Thinking...
Alright, let's see what I have to do here. The user provided a piece of code with a syntax error and an error message saying "syntax error." My task is to fix the code using only the information from the error message and without any pre-trained knowledge beyond that.

Looking at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

First, I notice that this looks like some sort of conditional statement. The `if` keyword suggests it's either C-like or another language with similar syntax. But there are parts that don't make sense to me because the code isn't in any language I'm familiar with.

The error message is just "syntax error," which usually means something is wrong with how the code is structured. Let's break down the code line by line.

Starting with `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` This part seems to have an `if` condition, then some operator or keyword `@`, followed by an assignment `a=1`. The semicolon at the end ends the statement. But I don't know what `@` does here.

Then there's another line: `# else b = 2; #`. The `#` symbols look like comments in C-like languages, but they're placed right after `if` and before the rest of the code. This might be causing issues because comments can't be placed inside expressions or statements that expect certain structures.

Putting this together, I think the problem is that the code isn't properly structured as a valid statement. The `@` operator doesn't make sense here unless it's part of a specific language, which I don't recognize from the context. Also, having comments right after the `if` statement might be causing syntax issues.

Maybe the user intended to write an `if-else` block where if `x > 0`, then assign `a=1`, else assign `b=2`. So the code should have both branches properly separated and without the extra comments messing things up.

So, I'll try removing the `@` since it's not recognized. Then, ensure that each part is correctly placed on separate lines with proper indentation to avoid syntax errors caused by misplaced statements or comments.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
