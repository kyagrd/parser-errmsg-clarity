Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix a syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

First, the user provided an error message: "syntax error." That means something's wrong with how the code is written.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces `}` after the else statement. The if block has one `}`, and then after else, there's another `}` before the final one. That might be causing the issue.

In programming languages like C or Java, each conditional block needs to have its own pair of curly braces. So in this case, the outer if-else structure should have only two braces: one opening and one closing. But here, it looks like there are three braces instead of two because after else, another `}` is added.

Wait, let me count again:

1. The if condition starts with `{`.
2. Then inside the block, `a = 1;` ends with `}`.
3. After that, the else statement's code is written as `b = 2;`.
4. Then there's another `}`, which probably shouldn't be there because it's closing the outer if block again.

So actually, after else b=2;, there should only be one more `}` to close both the if and else blocks together. But in the current code, there are two `}` after else, causing an extra brace that doesn't belong.

Therefore, I need to remove the extra closing brace right after else. That way, each block is properly closed once, avoiding the syntax error.

So the corrected code should have only one closing brace for the if-else structure. Let me adjust it:

Remove the extra `}` after else b=2;. The correct structure would be:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Yes, that looks better. Each statement inside if and else is properly enclosed with one `{}` each, without any extra braces causing the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace which causes the syntax error. Removing the duplicate brace fixes it.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Identified that there are three closing braces instead of two.
2. Removed one closing brace after `else` to have only two braces for the if-else structure.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
