Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that there are two closing braces here: one after a=1 and another at the end of the line before the semicolon. That's probably causing the syntax error because each block inside an if statement should be properly enclosed within just one pair.

So, I need to remove the extra brace. The corrected code should have only one opening brace right after the if condition and one closing brace at the end of the else block without any duplicates.

Let me rewrite it step by step. First, keep the if statement structure correct. Then, ensure that each block is enclosed properly with just one set of braces.

After fixing, the code should look like this:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

I think that's all. The syntax error was due to having two closing braces which caused an extra brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error because of an extra closing curly brace. We need to remove one of them.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Identify duplicate braces in the code block.
2. Remove one closing brace to fix the syntax error.
3. Ensure the corrected code runs without errors.

The fixed code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
