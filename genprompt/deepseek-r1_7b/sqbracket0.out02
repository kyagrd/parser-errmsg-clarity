Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and then the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I see that it's an if-else statement in some programming language. The code inside the if is written as [ a = 1; ], which looks like it might be trying to use an array or maybe some sort of syntax for variable assignment within square brackets. Then there's an else clause with b = 2; and then another ] after that.

Wait, so the structure is: if (condition) [ code ] else [code]; ]

But looking at this, I think the problem might be with how the braces are being used. In many programming languages like C++ or Java, you use curly braces { } for blocks. So maybe they're trying to use square brackets instead of curly braces.

So in the if statement, it's written as (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I think that's incorrect because the code inside if and else should be enclosed within curly braces, not square brackets. The square brackets are typically used for arrays or other array-like structures.

So the corrected version would change the square brackets to curly braces. Let me write that out:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript, if statements don't require blocks unless there are multiple statements. But here, they have semicolons and multiple assignments, so it's better to enclose the code inside curly braces for clarity and correctness.

So putting it all together, I think the correct syntax would be replacing [ ] with { }, which fixes the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error because it uses square brackets `[ ]` instead of curly braces `{ }` in conditional statements. In many programming languages, including JavaScript, curly braces are required to denote blocks of code inside conditionals like `if`. 

Here's the fixed version:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This correction uses curly braces around the code block within the if statement.
