Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a given code snippet. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error" and some code that's not working. My task is to fix it using only the information from the error message, without relying on any pre-existing knowledge.

First, let me understand what the original code looks like:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that this is some sort of conditional statement because it starts with "if" and has an "else". The structure seems to be in a language where the code inside the if and else blocks are enclosed within these special characters, maybe like single quotes or something similar.

Looking at the error message: syntax error. That usually means there's a problem with how the code is structured. Maybe missing brackets, incorrect indentation, or wrong use of operators.

Now, let me analyze the code line by line:

1. The if statement starts with "if (x > 0) ". That seems correct as long as it's properly formatted.
2. Then there's this part: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; .

Hmm, I see that after the if condition, there are these characters: 《 and 》 which might be acting as delimiters for the code block inside the if statement. Similarly, at the end, there's another pair of 》 around "else b = 2;".

Wait a minute, usually in languages like Python, we use indentation within the if-else blocks. But looking at this, it seems more like using single quotes to enclose statements because I see each condition is followed by a semicolon.

But here's where it gets tricky. The code inside the if statement isn't properly indented or closed. Let me break it down:

The line starts with "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》"

So, maybe the structure is trying to say: If x>0 then run code inside the first set of brackets and do something else if not.

But in reality, each block after 《 should be properly indented. The original code might have missed that indentation, causing a syntax error because the interpreter doesn't recognize where each statement ends.

Looking at it again:

- The first part is "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》"

Wait, actually, this looks like two separate if statements, which isn't correct. Because after the initial if, there's an else, so it should be one if-else block.

But looking at how it's written: "if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2;"

I think the problem is that each statement inside the brackets isn't properly indented. In many programming languages, you can have multiple statements within an if or else clause, but they need to be aligned correctly.

So perhaps in this case, using single quotes to denote code blocks doesn't require proper indentation for each line. Alternatively, maybe it's more like PHP where 《 and 》 are used as tags similar to HTML, so the content inside needs to be properly formatted without any nested code blocks.

But regardless of the specific syntax, I can see that in the original code, there are two code blocks: one under if (x>0) with "a=1;" and another under else with "b=2;". But they aren't correctly enclosed or indented.

Looking at it again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 

This is missing the indentation after 《. So, in code blocks, each line inside should be indented to show hierarchy. Without proper indentation, the interpreter might get confused about where each statement ends.

Therefore, adding proper indentation within the brackets would fix this syntax error. Also, I notice that the else part isn't properly enclosed within a code block, so wrapping it with 》 at the end is correct but needs to be placed correctly.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should have "a=1;" indented under the if statement and "b=2;" as an else clause without any indentation since it's at the same level.

So, the fixed code would look like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But using the original delimiters with proper syntax. Alternatively, if using single quotes for code blocks, it should be structured without mixing multiple statements incorrectly.

In this case, I think adding indentation after each 《 and 》 would fix the issue.
...done thinking.

The original code has a missing semicolon inside an incorrect structure. The corrected version properly places the conditions within their respective code blocks with correct syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively, if using delimiters as given:

```fix
if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2;}
```
