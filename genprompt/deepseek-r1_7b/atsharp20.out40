Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and wants me to fix it using only the information from the error message, without any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's in the error itself.

First, I know that in many programming languages like C or Java, when you have an if-else statement, you can't just write multiple statements on the same line without some separation. Also, semicolons are usually used to end statements, but sometimes they might be used differently based on the language.

Looking at the code, I see "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" There's an @ symbol in there which I'm not familiar with. But since it's causing a syntax error, maybe that's part of the problem. In Python, for example, you can use multi-line conditional statements with proper indentation and line breaks using semicolons or parentheses.

Wait, but how does this code compile? If I think about C, in C you might have to use else if or curly braces, but here it's written as # else which doesn't look right. Maybe the @ is a typo for an operator that isn't valid here, like maybe it should be something else.

Another thought: perhaps the @ symbol was intended to separate two different statements, but without proper line breaks or indentation, it's causing a syntax error. So maybe I need to insert some kind of line break after the if condition so that each statement is on its own line with correct indentation.

Also, considering that in languages like C or Java, you can use the ternary operator for single-line conditions, but here there are two separate assignments inside an if-else structure. So perhaps using a backslash at the end of the first line would allow it to continue on the next line without breaking syntax.

Putting this together, I think adding a semicolon after @a=1; and then starting the else block on a new line with proper indentation might fix the issue. Alternatively, maybe just inserting a backslash at the end so that the code continues on the same line but is split into multiple lines for readability.

Wait, in some languages like JavaScript, you can use ; to separate statements, but here it's written as @a=1; which seems out of place. Maybe replacing the @ with something else or ensuring each statement ends correctly.

But considering that I need to fix this using only what's provided and common syntax errors, perhaps adding a semicolon after 1; would make it correct, but looking at C-like syntax, maybe adding backslashes for line continuation could work.

I think the main issue is improper line breaks or incorrect operator usage. So by inserting a backslash after @a=1;, I can split the statement into multiple lines without causing a syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) \n@ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
