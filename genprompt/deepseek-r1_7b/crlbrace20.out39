Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message is just a syntax error, which probably means there's something wrong with the structure of the code.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I notice that after the if statement, there's an else block but it doesn't have braces. In most programming languages like C or Java, each conditional block needs to be properly enclosed with curly braces {}.

So in the original code, after the else keyword, the line 'b = 2;' isn't indented and doesn't start at the same level as the if's body. That probably causes a syntax error because the compiler thinks it's outside the if statement's block.

I should add curly braces to both the if and the else parts. The if condition is correct, but the else part is missing its opening brace. Also, after the if block, I need to make sure that all statements are properly indented under their respective blocks.

So putting it together, the corrected code would have an opening brace after the if statement, then the a=1; line inside it, and then the closing brace for the if block followed by the else statement with its own braces.

Wait, no. Actually, in this case, the original code has 'a = 1;' correctly indented under the if, but the else doesn't have any braces, which would make the code treat everything after else as part of the if's body until a semicolon, which isn't intended here.

So to fix it, I need to properly enclose both branches with their own braces. So the corrected code should have:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense because each statement inside if or else needs its own block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
