Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me look at the code they gave:

```fixme
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I notice that there's a hashtag `#` right after the else statement. In Ruby, we use the keyword `rescue` to handle exceptions, not `@`, but maybe the user meant something else here.

Wait, in the code, they have `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. So after the if statement's block ends with `@ a = 1;`, there's a `#` which is probably the end of a comment. But then another `#` after `else`.

Ruby syntax requires that once an if/else structure is closed, you shouldn't have more statements outside unless they are part of a multi-line string or something else.

So the problem is that the `else b = 2;` is inside the if block because it's right after `@ a = 1;`. Also, those hashtags at the end might be trying to comment out lines but are misplaced.

I think the intention was probably to write an else clause correctly. So maybe they meant:

If x > 0, then set @a =1, else set @b=2.

So I'll rewrite it without the extra `@` in if and else parts because that's not correct Ruby syntax. Instead, inside the condition blocks, you use colons or semicolons appropriately.

So the corrected code should be:

```ruby
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1;
else
  @b = 2;
end
```

That way, the if statement properly ends with `end`, and each block is correctly enclosed. Also, I removed the hashtags since they were causing syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1; 
else
  @b = 2;
end
```
