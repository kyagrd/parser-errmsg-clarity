Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

The user provided an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests there's a character that doesn't belong here.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice some odd characters: '《' and '》'. These look like full-width brackets, probably not intended in this context. The error mentions an unexpected '》', so maybe these are causing issues.

The code structure seems to be trying to write something like:
if (condition) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But the semicolons after the statements and the use of full-width brackets is messing things up. 

So, first, I'll replace '《' with '<' because those are standard less-than signs in if conditions. Similarly, the closing '》' should be replaced with '>'.

Also, looking at the spacing: there's a space before the else clause which might not be necessary but isn't causing an error here.

So, the corrected code should remove the full-width brackets and adjust the semicolons to fit properly without trailing spaces. The else part shouldn't have a semicolon after it because that would close the if statement incorrectly.

Putting it all together, I'll structure it as:
if (x > 0) <a = 1;> else b = 2;
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) <a = 1;> else b = 2;
```
