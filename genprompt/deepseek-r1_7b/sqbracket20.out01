Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The user mentioned there's a syntax error, and they want me to fix it without using pre-trained knowledge, just based on the error message provided.

The code given is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

First, I notice that in many programming languages, like C or Java, you can't have statements directly inside an if-else block unless they're part of control structures like ternary operators. But the code uses square brackets `[]` around some parts, which makes me think it might be using a different syntax, perhaps something from JavaScript where square brackets are used for object literals, but that's not likely here.

Looking at the structure: there's an if condition checking if x is greater than 0. Inside the if block, there's `[ a = 1; ]`. Then, outside of any control flow after the else keyword, it has `b = 2; ]`.

Hmm, I'm thinking that in JavaScript, you can have an if statement with an else, but you can't just place statements inside without proper syntax. The square brackets might be causing confusion because they're used for arrays or objects.

Wait, maybe this is a typo. Let's parse the code step by step.

1. The if condition: `if (x > 0)` — that seems fine.
2. Inside the if block: `[ a = 1; ]` — In JavaScript, to create an array with statements inside, you'd use something like `[1, 2].map()`, but this isn't correct syntax because it's not valid for assignment within square brackets. Maybe they intended to have multiple statements in a list or as part of another construct.
3. Then the else clause: `else b = 2; ]` — Again, the closing bracket is incorrect here.

I think the problem is that the code isn't properly structured. The square brackets are not being used correctly. Perhaps the user meant to use braces `{}` for the if-else block because those define the scope more clearly and avoid syntax issues with the square brackets.

So, replacing `[` and `]` with `{` and `}` might fix the issue. Let me see:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wait, but in this case, inside each if-else block, there's only one statement: `a=1` or `b=2`. So using braces is correct here because it groups the statements properly.

Alternatively, maybe the code was trying to use an array structure with the assignments. But that doesn't make much sense because you can't assign values inside square brackets like that in JavaScript without some sort of object or array declaration context.

Another possibility is that they were using a different language where square brackets have a specific syntax, but since the user mentioned it's similar to C, Java, Python, etc., I should stick with common practices. So braces are definitely safer here because if-else blocks need proper scoping, and using { and } would avoid any confusion.

So putting it all together, the fixed code would replace the square brackets with curly braces.
...done thinking.

The syntax error occurs because the code uses `[` and `]` instead of `{}` to define the control flow block. Replacing them fixes the issue.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
