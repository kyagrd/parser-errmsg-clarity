Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

Looking at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I notice that there are square brackets around `a = 1` and after the else clause. In many programming languages like C or Java, using square brackets inside an if-else statement isn't valid because those brackets would typically denote arrays or other structures, not part of a condition.

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. That suggests that the closing bracket is causing a problem. Let me count the brackets to see where things are off.

The code starts with `(x > 0) [`, then `a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. So, from the structure, it looks like there's an opening square bracket right after the condition, which might be unnecessary. Maybe those square brackets were meant to be part of a different construct.

Wait, perhaps these square brackets are trying to denote some kind of array or list assignment in the code. But how does that fit into an if-else statement? That doesn't make sense because if-else is for conditional statements, not for arrays.

So, maybe those square brackets should be removed entirely. If I take them out, the code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But wait, in many languages like C or Java, you can't just assign variables inside an if-else statement like that without proper scoping or block structures. However, perhaps this is part of another language where such assignments are allowed. Alternatively, maybe the code was meant to be a ternary operator but written incorrectly.

Another possibility is that the square brackets were intended for an array initializer within the condition, but I don't think that's standard syntax in most languages. So it's more likely that those brackets were mistakenly added and should be removed.

Alternatively, perhaps the user used incorrect syntax for some feature of the language they're using. For example, if this is a JavaScript-like snippet where you might use objects or arrays within conditions, but I don't think square brackets are allowed in conditionals like that.

So to fix the error, I'll remove the extra square brackets so that each statement inside the if-else is on its own line without any unnecessary brackets. This should eliminate the unexpected ']' error because those brackets were causing an imbalance.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
