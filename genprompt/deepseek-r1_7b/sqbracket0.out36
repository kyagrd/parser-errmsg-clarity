Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the problem step by step.

The user provided the following code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

They mentioned that there's a syntax error and asked me to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge, just relying on the error message. So I can't think about what "a" or "b" should mean beyond their literal definitions here.

First, looking at the code structure. The main issue is likely incorrect syntax in an if-else statement. In many programming languages, such as JavaScript or Python, the conditions inside if and else must be properly formatted with correct braces.

Looking closely, after the if condition (x > 0), there's a line [ a = 1; ] which probably means that the code is trying to add an object literal or something similar. But then it's followed by an else without any opening structure, leading to an unclosed block.

So I think the problem is that the if statement is incomplete and has a syntax error because of the way the braces are used. The [ ] here doesn't seem like valid syntax in this context—it might be a mistake for curly braces { }, which are typically used to denote code blocks in JavaScript.

Also, looking at how the else is placed: there's no opening brace before 'else', causing a syntax error because the block isn't properly closed. So perhaps the original code intended to have an if statement with a single-line condition inside and then an else clause outside of it.

Putting this together, I'll need to correct the syntax by replacing [ ] with { }, ensuring that each block is properly enclosed. Additionally, there's probably a missing semicolon after the opening brace of the if statement or maybe the else wasn't preceded by a brace correctly.

So the corrected code should have an if condition followed by its body within curly braces and then the else clause also within its own set of curly braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
