Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me look at what's given.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

And the error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which was already closed by an earlier 《. So I think this has to do with some kind of brackets or delimiters.

Looking at the code, it seems like the user is using 《 and 》 symbols instead of regular parentheses or another pair. In programming languages like C or Java, you use () for conditionals, but here they're using 《 and 》. Maybe these are placeholders for some kind of custom syntax in their language.

So the structure is: if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2; 》

Wait, that's confusing because after the else statement, there's another 》 which might not be needed. So perhaps each conditional clause should have its own pair of these symbols.

In many languages, you don't need to enclose the body of an if-else in parentheses unless required by syntax. Maybe here, using () is unnecessary and causing the error because they're expecting a different kind of structure.

So maybe the code should be rewritten without the extra parentheses inside the conditionals. Let me try:

if (x > 0) 《a = 1;》 else b = 2;

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps each part after the if/else needs its own block.

Wait, looking at the original code again: The user wrote "if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2; 》". So after the else statement, there's another closing bracket which might be unnecessary because the outer structure is already closed by the initial if and its own 》.

So maybe removing that last 》 would fix the error. Let me try:

if (x >0)《 a =1; 》else b=2;

But I'm not sure if this makes sense in their syntax. Alternatively, perhaps they're using curly braces for blocks, so each clause inside else should have its own.

Wait, maybe the original code was trying to use {} but wrote 《 and 》 instead by mistake. So replacing them with parentheses could also help.

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistakenly mixing up different bracket types. Perhaps the code uses 《 as if for one block and } for another. But that seems unlikely.

So putting it all together, I think the main issue is having an extra closing symbol after else. So removing that last 》 should fix the error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x >0)《 a =1;》else b=2;
```
