Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that inside the if statement, there are square brackets around "a = 1;" followed by a semicolon and a closing bracket. Then after the else clause, there's another ']'.

Wait, maybe these brackets aren't needed here. In JavaScript, when you have an if-else statement, it's common to use braces for the code block. But in some cases, people might use square brackets instead of curly braces, but that could cause issues.

Looking at the structure: after the if condition, they're closing the bracket with ] and then putting else inside another ]. So perhaps those extra brackets are causing the problem.

Let me try removing the brackets around "a = 1;". That would change it to:
if (x > 0) a = 1; ]

But wait, now after the if block closes with ], there's an else statement and then another ]. The syntax is messed up because the ] might be closing something that isn't supposed to.

Maybe instead of using square brackets around "a = 1;", they should use curly braces. So it would look like:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Alternatively, if I want to keep the square brackets but structure them correctly, perhaps nesting isn't necessary here.

But considering standard syntax, using curly braces is better for clarity and avoiding confusion with the if-else structure. So replacing [ ] with { } should fix the error without changing functionality.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
