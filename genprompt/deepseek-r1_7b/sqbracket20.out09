Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet with a syntax error. The user provided the error message: syntax error. Let me look at the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see that it's an if-else statement in some programming language. But looking at the structure, after the if block, there's an else clause that seems incomplete.

Wait, normally an if statement has two parts: the condition and the body. The code starts with "if (x > 0) [" which is a bit odd because it ends with a bracket [ . Then inside the brackets is "a = 1; ]", but there's an else followed by another block that also ends with ].

So, I think the problem is the syntax of the if statement. Let me try to parse this. The code starts with if (x > 0) [, which looks like it's trying to write a condition but perhaps messed up the structure. Maybe the brackets are misplaced or not used correctly.

In many languages, an if-else block has the form:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in this code, after the if statement's opening bracket, there's another ] which might be causing issues. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use angle brackets for some kind of syntax but it's not correct.

Wait, looking again: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". The code has two closing brackets at the end, which might be causing an extra one or misplacing.

Another possibility is that the if statement should have braces {} but in this case, maybe it's using square brackets instead. However, I'm not sure if the language allows that.

Wait, perhaps the original code was trying to use parentheses for a different purpose, like function calls, but within an array? That seems unlikely because arrays are usually denoted with square brackets.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have an else statement without an opening condition. Let me check: after if (x>0), there's [a=1;], then ] else b=2; ]. So the else is outside of any block, which might be incorrect because in most languages, else has to follow an if or if-else construct.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to have a single line with both conditions but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe they meant to write multiple statements within each condition but messed up the syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps the brackets are mismatched. Let's count: after "if (x>0) [" there's another "]" at the end of the if block, which would close it properly. Then, the else statement is outside, and ends with a ";" and another "]". So that might be causing an extra bracket.

Wait, looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So after if, there's [, then a=1;, ], else..., ;, ]. Hmm. The last ] is probably an error because it closes something that shouldn't be closed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure should have braces {} for the if-else block, but in this case, maybe they used square brackets instead of curly braces. But I'm not sure if that's allowed in the target language.

Wait, another approach: let's see how many opening and closing brackets there are. The code starts with "if (x > 0) [" which is one [. Then inside, a=1; ], so two ]s? Wait no, after [a=1;] comes a ], then else b=2; followed by another ].

Wait, maybe the user intended to write something like:

if (x>0) { ... } else { ... }

But instead of braces, they used brackets. So perhaps replacing [ and ] with {} would fix it. Let me try that.

So changing the code to:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense. The original code had mismatched brackets causing syntax errors because it was trying to close the if block too early and then having an extra ] at the end which didn't belong.

So the error is due to using square brackets instead of braces for the if-else block, leading to incorrect syntax.
...done thinking.

The syntax error in the code arises from the use of square brackets `[` and `]` within the if statement. These should be replaced with curly braces `{}` to correctly define the scope of the if-else block.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
