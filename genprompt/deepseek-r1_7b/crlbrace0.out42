Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." Let me look at the code they gave:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, where could the problem be? Well, in programming, each control structure needs to have its blocks properly closed. So let's break it down.

First, I see an if statement: if (x > 0). Then inside the curly braces, there's a semicolon after assigning a = 1;. That looks okay so far. Then comes else b = 2; followed by another closing brace } but wait, is that correct?

Wait, in the code provided, after the else statement, it ends with a single semicolon and then another closing brace. Let me visualize this:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else
    b = 2;

Oh, I see! The original code has only one closing brace at the end. But in reality, an if-else statement should have two separate blocks: one for the if and one for the else. So each block is enclosed within its own curly braces.

In the given code, after the first if block closes with }, then the else part starts but doesn't enclose its assignment in braces. Then it ends with another }, which might be incorrect because that would create an empty statement at the end of the else clause.

Wait no, actually, looking again: The code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block closes with }, then there's an else followed by b=2; and another }. So it's structured like this:

Line 1: if (x>0) {
Line 2:    a=1;
Line 3: } else
Line 4:    b=2;
Line 5: }

Wait, but in the original code, it's written without braces around the else part. So actually, the else is attached to the last if statement unless we enclose it in braces.

But more importantly, the syntax error here is probably because there are two closing braces before the else block ends. Let me check: The first } closes the if block. Then after that, the code has an else followed by b=2; and then another }, which would end the program or function if it's at the end.

Wait no, in this case, since the else is part of the if statement, without braces around the else clause, it should still be valid as a single-statement else. But perhaps the issue is that there are two closing braces? Let me count: The code ends with } }, so maybe that's causing an extra brace which isn't needed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the if statement has only one semicolon after its body, but I think that's fine because each statement inside should have a semicolon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to structure this with braces for both cases to make it explicit and avoid any confusion. So adding braces around both the if and else parts would fix the syntax error by making the code more readable and ensuring proper block structures.

So rewriting the code:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each condition has its own block with braces. This should resolve the syntax issue because now each statement is properly enclosed within its control structure.
...done thinking.

The original code had an extra closing brace and was missing proper block structures for the if-else statements. By adding braces around both conditions, we ensure that each part of the code is correctly enclosed.

```fixer
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
