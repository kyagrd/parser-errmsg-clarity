Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first thing I notice is those symbols '《' and '》'. I think they might be comments or something else, but in the context of an if statement, that's not right. Also, looking at the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So it seems like there's a problem with the brackets.

Let me break it down. The code starts with an if statement: if (x > 0). Then inside, there's this part where they write 《a = 1; 》. Wait, that looks like someone tried to add comments or maybe something else in between the parentheses of the if condition. But no, because after the parenthesis, it should be a colon, not some other characters.

Looking further, after the first 》, there's an else clause: else b = 2; and then another 》. So the structure is:

if (condition) {code}; else {another code};

But in this case, between the if condition and the else, they have these 《 and 》 symbols which don't belong. It looks like they might be trying to use HTML comments or something, but that's incorrect here.

So, probably, those 《 and 》 are causing issues because they're not valid syntax in an if statement. The error message mentions unexpected '》' after else clause, so the problem is that there's a closing bracket (》) where it shouldn't be.

Let me count the brackets. After the if condition, which has parentheses, then comes 《a =1; 》. Then outside that, they have else b=2; and another 》. So the structure becomes:

if (...)《...》else ...;

Which is invalid because the 《...》 should be within the if block, not part of the syntax.

So to fix this, I think those 《 and 》 should just be removed or properly closed with proper comment delimiters. Alternatively, maybe they were meant to be comments but placed incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be an if-else without any extra characters. So the correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But in the original code, instead of braces {}, they used these 《 and 》 symbols which are not valid. So the solution is to replace those with proper braces.

So the corrected code would have if (...){ ... } else {...}, without any extra characters between them.

Alternatively, maybe the person meant to use HTML comments or something, but that's unnecessary here because in Java, C++, etc., you can't use those symbols. So it's likely a mistake and should be removed.

Therefore, I'll remove the 《》 around 'a=1;' and also fix the placement of else so that it doesn't have an extra } after it.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect syntax because of the unexpected `》` symbol after the else clause. The delimiters `《` and `》` are not valid in an if statement and should be removed to use proper braces `{}` instead.

**Fixed Code:**
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
