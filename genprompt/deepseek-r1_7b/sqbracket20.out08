Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this code syntax error. The user provided a code snippet and an error message saying there's a syntax error. Let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, first off, I notice that inside the if statement, the condition is `x > 0`, which looks okay. Then there's this part `[ a = 1; ]`. In many programming languages like C or JavaScript, square brackets are used for array indexing or creating arrays. But in an if-else statement, using brackets might not be correct.

Wait, in some languages, you can use the ternary operator which is a single line condition, but here it's inside an if-else block. So maybe the issue is that they're trying to write something like assigning `a=1` when `x>0`, and then else assign `b=2`. But how?

Looking at the code again: after the if statement, there's `[ a = 1; ]`, but it ends with a semicolon. Then another `else b = 2; ]` which is also missing a semicolon for the closing bracket.

Wait, in many languages, you can write an assignment inside an if condition using the ternary operator: `(condition) ? (value if true) : (value if false);`. So maybe they intended to use that. Let me see:

The correct syntax would be `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. But in their code, the opening bracket after if is causing issues because it's not part of an if-else block.

Alternatively, using the ternary operator could simplify this. So maybe replacing the entire structure with `(x > 0) ? (a = 1) : (b = 2);` and removing the unnecessary brackets and semicolons.

Wait, but in some languages, you can assign variables inside a single expression like that. For example, if `x>0`, then set a=1 else b=2 as a one-liner.

So putting it all together, perhaps the code should be rewritten to use the ternary operator correctly. That would fix the syntax because we're removing unnecessary brackets and semicolons around statements.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) ? (a = 1) : (b = 2);
```
