Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is written inside triple backticks, which probably means it's some kind of code block highlighting. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that there are these 《 and 》 symbols around the if statement and another one at the end. Those look like angle brackets or maybe some custom syntax markers. Let me check for common syntax errors.

First, in many programming languages, when you have an if-else block, each condition should be followed by a colon, then indented code. But looking at this, after 'if (x>0) 《', there's an assignment a=1; inside the angle brackets. That doesn't look right because usually, in if statements, you don't put everything inside like that unless it's a single statement.

Wait, maybe these symbols are not regular parentheses but something else, perhaps from another language or custom syntax. If I replace them with standard parentheses, would it make sense? Let me try:

if (x > 0) (a = 1;) else b = 2;

That looks better because now the if statement is correctly structured: condition followed by colon and indented block. The else clause follows without needing another set of brackets unless necessary.

But wait, in some languages like C or Java, when using braces for blocks, you have to be careful with scope. But here, maybe it's simpler. Replacing 《 and 》 with standard parentheses would fix the syntax because they were likely causing a mismatched block issue.

So, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) (a = 1;) else b = 2;

I think that's the right approach because it follows proper if-else syntax without any extra or missing brackets. The angle brackets were probably messing up the parser, causing a syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has mismatched brackets which are being handled by replacing them with standard parentheses.

The fixed code is:

if (x > 0) (a = 1;) else b = 2;

So the corrected output inside triple backticks is:
```
if (x > 0) (a = 1;) else b = 2;
```
