Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and provided some code. Let me look at the code carefully.

The code provided is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, looking at it, I see an if-else statement. In the if block, they have 'a=1;' which looks like an assignment inside the braces. Then in the else part, it's written as 'b=2;', but without any braces.

Wait, that might be the issue. In most programming languages, each conditional block (like if, else) needs to have its statements enclosed within curly braces. So the else statement should also have its own braces to avoid syntax errors because it's expecting a block of code inside.

So the original code ends with a semicolon after else b=2; but doesn't close the else clause properly. Instead of having an opening brace, it just has 'else' followed by the assignment without braces. This would cause a syntax error because the compiler or interpreter expects more code for the else part.

To fix this, I should add curly braces to both the if and else blocks. So the corrected code should look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each block has its own braces, making the syntax correct. The semicolon at the end of each statement is properly placed inside their respective blocks.

I think that's all. I just needed to ensure both conditional clauses have their own braces to fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code had a syntax error because the else clause was missing curly braces. Fixed by adding braces for both if and else blocks.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
