Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and some code that's not working. My task is to correct the code based solely on the error message without using any pre-existing knowledge beyond what's given.

First, I'll examine the error message: "syntax error." That means there's something wrong with the structure or syntax of the code provided. Now, looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I can see that this is an if-else statement in some programming language. The code inside the if condition and the else part are wrapped with these characters: 《 and 》, which I assume are Unicode brackets or maybe placeholders for actual syntax highlighting markers.

Wait, in many languages like Java or C++, we use curly braces { } to denote blocks of code. So perhaps those 《 and 》 are meant to represent curly braces but were written incorrectly as Chinese quotation marks or something else.

Looking closely at the code: after the if statement's opening parenthesis, there's a line with "a = 1;" followed by these 《 brackets. Then, in the else part, it's "b = 2;" and another 》 bracket.

So maybe the correct syntax should be using curly braces { } instead of those other characters. Also, I notice that after the if block, there's an extra closing brace at the end which might not be needed.

Let me try to parse this line by line. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;

Wait, actually, looking again, it's written as if (x>0) followed by some characters and then else b=2;. But the way it's formatted makes me think that maybe the code was intended to have an if statement with a single-line condition and body, followed by an else clause.

So, perhaps the structure should be:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in the original code, after the 《, which I assume is supposed to be {, there's "a=1;", then another closing brace 》, which might be }, but maybe misplaced. Then in the else part, it's missing a brace before b=2.

So putting that together, perhaps the corrected code should have proper braces wrapping each block.

Let me reconstruct:

The correct if-else statement would look like this:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each block inside the if and else is properly enclosed in curly braces. The extra closing brace at the end of the original code was likely an error because it's not needed.

So replacing the 《 with { and ensuring that both blocks have their own braces should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
