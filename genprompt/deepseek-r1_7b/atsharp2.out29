Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code snippet provided by the user:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause, which suggests that the 'else' statement is followed by something it shouldn't be. 

In many programming languages like C or Java, the 'else' keyword comes right after the if condition without any space or operator in between. For example: if (x > 0) else { ... }

Looking at the code, I notice that after the closing parenthesis of the if statement, there's an '@', followed by a space and then '#'. This doesn't make sense because '#' is not part of the syntax for an else clause.

I think the user might have intended to use an 'else' without any operator. So maybe they meant to write something like:

if (x > 0) @a = 1; else b = 2;

But looking at the code, it's written as '# else b = 2; #', which is incorrect. The '#' here might be a comment or an attempt to separate lines, but it's not needed there.

So, to fix this, I should remove the '#' and adjust how the else clause is written. Since the 'else' needs to come immediately after the closing parenthesis of the if statement without any space in some languages like C. However, since the code uses ';' as a terminator (like C), maybe it's more about separating statements.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the code was trying to split lines with '#' but that's not standard syntax for else clauses. So I think the correct approach is to remove the '#' and ensure that 'else' follows directly after the if statement without any operator in between.

So the corrected line should be:

if (x > 0) @a = 1; else b = 2;

This way, there's no '#' causing an error, and the syntax for the if-else is correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
