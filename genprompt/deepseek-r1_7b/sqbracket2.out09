Thinking...
Okay, let's look at this code and see where the problem is. The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, there's a syntax issue causing a ] to appear incorrectly.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I notice that after the if-else block, there are two closing brackets: one for ] and another ]. The first part is an if statement with an else. Inside the if condition, they have `[ a = 1; ]`, which looks like array or list syntax maybe from JavaScript. But it's inside an if statement.

Wait, in many programming languages, you don't need square brackets around assignments unless you're dealing with arrays or lists. So perhaps those square brackets are unnecessary here and causing the extra closing bracket.

The code probably meant to write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in their code, they have [ a=1; ] which might be incorrect syntax. So I should remove those square brackets around 'a = 1;' and adjust the structure.

Also, after the if-else block, there's an extra ]. Since it's an if statement, maybe only one else is needed. So perhaps removing that last ] as well.

So putting it together, the fixed code would have the if condition with proper braces and remove unnecessary brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
