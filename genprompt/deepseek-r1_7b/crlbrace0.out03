Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error and gave me an example of incorrect code along with the output. Let me look at what the problem is.

The original code given is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I know that in programming, each statement should be properly structured and closed. In this case, looking at the if-else structure, it's likely an issue with the braces.

First, I notice that after the else keyword, there's a semicolon instead of a brace. The code ends with `} else b = 2; }`. Wait, no, actually, the code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

So it starts with an if statement that has braces `{}`, then inside, there's an assignment. Then outside the if block, after else, there's another line `b=2;` without braces. That's probably the error because each condition in an if-else should be enclosed within curly braces.

Also, at the end of the code, it ends with a semicolon `}` which is causing a syntax error. Wait no, looking again: The original code has two closing braces? Or perhaps just one?

Wait, let me count:

1. if (x > 0) { - that's opening brace inside.
2. a = 1; } else b=2;

So the first line is an if statement with a block inside, then outside the if-else structure, it has `} else b=2;`. Wait no, the code as written would be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

Wait, but how many braces are there? Let's parse this step by step.

The first line is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` – that's correct inside the if block. Then comes `else b = 2;`. But since it's part of an if-else statement, it should be enclosed within braces `{ ... }`.

Wait no, actually, in many languages like JavaScript or Java, each condition must have its own block. So the structure is:

if (condition) {
   code;
} else {
   code;
}

So in this case, both if and else need their own blocks with curly braces.

Looking at the original code: it's written as `if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }` – so after else, there's no opening brace. That's the issue. The else statement is not inside a block.

So to fix this, I should add the missing braces for the else part. So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Additionally, at the end of the if-else structure, there's another closing brace that doesn't belong. The original code ends with `}` which is after else, but since we've enclosed both branches within their own braces, we can remove that trailing brace.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should have each condition (if and else) inside its own curly braces, removing any extra or misplaced braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
