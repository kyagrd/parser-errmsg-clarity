Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message is just "syntax error," which means there's something wrong with the code that makes it invalid according to Python's grammar rules.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice a few issues here. First, the syntax uses curly braces {} instead of parentheses for the if statement and its block. In Python, we use parentheses for conditionals. So that's one mistake.

The code also ends with an extra closing brace }, which doesn't match any opening brace in Python. That's causing the syntax error because Python expects only proper indentation and matching braces.

Looking closer, after the if statement, there's an else block written as 'else b = 2; }', but again without parentheses around it. In Python, each conditional block should be enclosed within its own set of parentheses. So the structure should be:

if condition:
    do something
elif another condition:
    do something else

But in this case, there's no elif, just an else clause attached to the if. However, using 'else' without being part of an 'if-else' block might not always be correct, but perhaps it's intended here.

Wait, actually, in Python, you can have a standalone else statement inside an if block, like:

if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But the original code uses curly braces and lacks proper indentation. So I think that's where the issue lies.

So to fix this, I'll change all the curly braces {} to parentheses (), ensuring correct syntax for Python. Also, I need to make sure each block is properly indented under its respective if or else statement.

Let me rewrite it step by step:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

First mistake: Using {} instead of (). So change them to ().

So the corrected line would be:
if (x > 0): a = 1;

Then, for the else part:
else: b = 2

But in the original code, there's no space before 'else', which is allowed but perhaps not necessary. However, that might not cause a syntax error because it's just an optional whitespace.

Wait, actually, in Python, you can write either:

if ...:
    ...
else:
    ...

or

if ...: 
    ...
else: 
    ...

with or without spaces after the keywords, which is generally allowed but considered bad practice. However, that doesn't cause a syntax error, so maybe that's not the issue.

The main problem seems to be using curly braces instead of parentheses and having an extra closing brace at the end.

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0): 
    a = 1
else: 
    b = 2

This way, each if-else block is properly enclosed within its own parentheses. Also, I added line breaks for better readability, though Python allows single-line conditionals without them.

Wait, in the original code, it's written as one line after else, but with an extra brace at the end. So perhaps that was causing the error because of the misplaced brace.

So to correct:

Change { and } to (), remove the trailing }, which is not needed unless it's part of a block.

Thus, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0): 
    a = 1
else: 
    b = 2

But I can also write it without line breaks for compactness:

if (x>0):a=1;else:b=2

That's more concise and correct because in Python, the colon ends the condition, and each statement is part of that block. So using ; to separate statements within the same line after the colon.

So another way to fix it without line breaks would be:

if (x>0):a=1;else:b=2

Which is a single line but correctly structured.

I think this addresses the syntax error by replacing braces with parentheses and removing the extra brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has two issues: using curly braces `{}` instead of parentheses `()` for conditional statements, which is invalid in Python. Additionally, there's an extra closing brace at the end that doesn't match any opening brace.

To fix this, we replace all curly braces with parentheses and remove the trailing brace:

if (x > 0): a = 1; else: b = 2

Here's the corrected code inside triple backticks:
```python
if (x > 0): a = 1; else: b = 2
```
