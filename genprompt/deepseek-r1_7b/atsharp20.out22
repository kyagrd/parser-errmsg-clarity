Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code with a syntax error. The user provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The first thing I notice is the '@' symbol after if. In programming languages like C or Java, the '@' isn't used there—it's part of annotations or generics. But in this context, it seems out of place.

Next, the code ends with '# else...'. That doesn't make sense because 'if' statements usually end with a semicolon and then an optional else statement. So the syntax is incorrect here.

I think the intention was to use an if-else block but perhaps with different operators or structures. Maybe they meant to have a ternary operator instead, which in some languages uses '@', like (x>0) ? 1 : 2. But that's speculative.

To fix this, I can remove the '@' since it's causing a syntax error. Then, I'll ensure proper semicolon usage after each statement. So rewriting it as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This makes sense because each condition block is properly terminated with a semicolon and the entire structure is enclosed in curly braces for clarity.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
