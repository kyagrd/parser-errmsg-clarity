Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message which just says "syntax error," but no specific details about where exactly the issue is. That makes it a bit tricky because without knowing more, there are multiple possible places where the error could be.

The original code given is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that this looks like it's trying to use some sort of syntax with angle brackets, but in programming, those are usually used for template literals or generics. The code starts with an `if` statement and then has two parts: one inside the parentheses where it assigns a=1 if x>0 is true, and another part outside which assigns b=2 when the else condition is met.

First, I'm thinking about the structure of an `if-else` statement. In most programming languages like JavaScript or Python, the syntax is:

```
if (condition) {
    // code block 1
} else {
    // code block 2
}
```

But in the given code, it's written without braces `{}` and instead uses these angle brackets `《 }`. That might be where the issue is. The user used backticks which are typically for template literals, not just angle brackets.

So maybe replacing the angle brackets with curly braces would fix it. Let me try that:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in JavaScript, you don't need to put semicolons inside the braces unless you have multiple statements. Here, `a=1;` is one statement, so it should be fine.

Alternatively, maybe the original code was trying to use a different kind of syntax that's not valid. For example, using 《 and 》 instead of curly braces might be causing the problem because those aren't recognized as block starters in most languages.

Another thing I notice is the extra closing angle bracket at the end. The code starts with `if (x > 0)`, then has 《 a =1; 》 else b=2; and another 》 at the end. So it's like having an extra pair of brackets that don't match.

Putting it all together, I think replacing the angle brackets with curly braces would fix both the syntax error and make the code more readable in most programming languages.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
