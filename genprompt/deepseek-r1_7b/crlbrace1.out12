Thinking...
Alright, so I've got this problem where there's a syntax error in some JavaScript code. The user provided the error message and the code snippet that needs fixing. Let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that after the else clause, there's another closing brace '}' which seems to be misplaced. The error message mentions an unexpected '}' after the else clause, indicating that this closing brace doesn't belong.

So, let me break it down step by step. The if statement is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

That looks correct so far—it's checking if x is greater than zero and then assigning a to 1. Now, the else part should probably have its own block. But in the code provided, after the else keyword, there's just 'b=2;' followed by another closing brace.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because each if-else statement needs an indented block under both clauses. So right now, the structure is:

if (...) { ... } else ...

But without braces for the else part. When the code compiles, it sees the 'else' and then expects a block of code but instead there's another closing brace which isn't necessary. That extra '}' is causing the problem because it closes the outer if statement prematurely.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that both the if and else parts have their own braces. The else should be followed by its own block before the closing brace of the entire if-else structure.

Looking back at the code, after the else clause 'b = 2;', there's an extra '}' which is causing the syntax error. So I need to remove that extra closing brace and properly close both the if and else blocks.

The corrected code should look like this:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes, by adding braces around the else clause, we fix the syntax error. Now, each condition has its own block, and there's no extra '}' that wasn't needed.
...done thinking.

The code incorrectly places an extra closing brace `}` after the `else` statement without a corresponding opening brace. To fix this, both branches of the if-else should have their own braces.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
