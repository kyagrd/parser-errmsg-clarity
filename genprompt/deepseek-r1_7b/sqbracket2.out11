Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code they provided:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

First, I notice that there's an if statement with an else clause. The structure looks like this: if (...) [ ... ] else ... ; ]

But wait, in most programming languages, after the else keyword, you usually have a block of code and then end with a semicolon or something similar. Also, the error message says there's an unexpected ']'. So maybe there's a missing bracket somewhere.

Looking closer, I see that inside the if condition, there's [a = 1; ], which is probably meant to be some kind of assignment within square brackets. But then after the else clause, there's another ] and a semicolon. That seems off because the first ] should close both the if block and maybe the else part.

Wait, no. Actually, in this code, the if statement has an else clause. The structure is:

if (condition) [ ... ] else ... ;

But that doesn't look right. In many languages, you don't put the entire if-else inside brackets like that unless it's a lambda or something. So perhaps the user intended to write separate blocks for if and else.

So maybe the correct code should have two separate blocks: one indented under if and another under else. That would fix the syntax because each clause has its own block without needing an extra ] at the end of the else part.

Let me try rewriting it:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

That way, each block is properly enclosed within curly braces and separated by the else clause. So I removed the extra brackets around [ a=1; ] and placed them inside their own blocks under if and else.

I think that should fix the syntax error because now each statement after if and else is correctly enclosed in its own block without an extra closing bracket at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
