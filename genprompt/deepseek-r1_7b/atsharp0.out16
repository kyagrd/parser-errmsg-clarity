Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it again: if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; # Hmm, I'm not sure what's wrong with this. 

First, I notice the line starts with an `if` statement, which in Python is written as `if condition:`. But here, it's written as `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`, which doesn't look like valid Python syntax to me. The @ symbol is used for decorators in Python, but I'm not sure if that's what's intended here.

Wait, maybe the user was trying to write some pseudocode or something else? Oh well, regardless, the code has syntax errors as per the error message given.

Looking at the structure: There are two lines after the `if` statement. The first line is `@ a = 1;`, which doesn't make sense because in Python, assignment statements should end with a semicolon only if you're not using an expression, but I think it's more about the colon here.

Then there's another line starting with `# else b = 2; #`. The `else` is intended after the `if`, so that part makes sense. But how is this structured? It seems like both lines are indented under the `if`, which might not be correct in Python because of indentation rules.

Wait, maybe it's a typo and the user meant to use an `elif` or just another clause inside the `if`. Alternatively, perhaps they're trying to write something else. 

But looking at the code again: The first line is `@ a = 1;`, which isn't valid Python syntax. I think that might be the main issue. So maybe the user meant to assign a value conditionally but used the @ symbol instead.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not about the if statement structure but just removing some invalid characters or correcting something else. But considering the error message is a syntax error and the code has lines starting with @ and # which are comment markers in Python, I need to figure out how they fit into this.

Wait, maybe the user intended to write an if-else block but mistakenly used these symbols elsewhere. So perhaps the correct approach is to fix that part. But looking again, it's using @ a = 1; which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be in another language where those symbols have different meanings, like JavaScript or something else. But since I can only use Python syntax here, maybe I need to remove those parts.

Wait, but if I just ignore the invalid lines and structure it properly as an if-else statement in Python, that might fix the issue. So perhaps the correct code should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

That way, each condition has its own line with proper syntax. The semicolons are used correctly for statements on one line.

So, in the given code, there's an `@` which is not part of Python, and lines inside the if that aren't properly indented or structured. So to fix it, I'll rewrite it as a standard if-else block without using any @ symbols.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error, we need to restructure the code into a proper Python `if-else` statement. The original code has invalid syntax due to the use of the `@` symbol and improper line organization.

The fixed code should correctly format each conditional clause with appropriate indentation:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

This structure follows Python's syntax rules, ensuring that each block within the `if-else` statement is properly defined and separated by colons followed by indented blocks.
