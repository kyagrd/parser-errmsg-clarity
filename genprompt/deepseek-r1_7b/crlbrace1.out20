Thinking...
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and the original code. Let me try to figure out what's wrong here step by step.

First, looking at the error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that suggests there's a problem with the curly braces. So, I should check where they are in the code.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, let me parse this line by line. The first part is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` which seems correct. Then there's an else clause: `else b = 2;`. But here's where it gets tricky. After the else statement, there's another curly brace `}` at the end of the line.

Wait, so the structure is:
- if condition opens with { and closes with }, then
- else starts, but what about its braces?

In most programming languages like JavaScript or Python, each conditional statement (if, else) should be enclosed within its own set of curly braces. So after the else keyword, there should be an opening brace `{` to start the block where the code inside the else clause goes.

Looking at the original code, I see that after `else`, it's followed by `b = 2; }`. That means after the else statement, there's a closing brace which is causing the syntax error. Because the first if statement has already closed its block with `{}`, so having another `}` right after else doesn't belong there.

So the mistake is that the code has an extra closing curly brace at the end of the else clause. It should be removed. The corrected code should have the else followed by a new block enclosed in braces, not share the same closing brace as the outer if statement.

Let me rewrite it properly. The fixed code should look like this:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Yes, that makes sense now. Each conditional block is enclosed in its own curly braces. So after `else`, we add `{` and the statement inside, then close it with `}` before the end of the function or script.

I think that's all there is to fix here. The main issue was the misplaced closing brace which caused a syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing curly brace which causes a syntax error. Removing this brace fixes the issue.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
