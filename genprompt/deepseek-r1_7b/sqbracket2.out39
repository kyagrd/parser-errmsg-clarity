Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So the issue is that there's an extra bracket causing a syntax error.

The original code given is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I notice that the if statement has parentheses around the condition, which is correct. After the closing parenthesis of the condition, there's an opening square bracket `[`. That seems out of place because in many languages like C or JavaScript, after an if block, you wouldn't put a [ without a corresponding ].

The error message suggests that there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Looking at the code, after `else b = 2;` there's another `]`, which is causing the problem because it's closing a bracket that wasn't opened properly in the if statement.

So I think the mistake here is probably using square brackets where they're not needed. Maybe the user intended to use curly braces `{}` for the if block instead of square brackets. In many languages, you can use square brackets as an alternative to curly braces when declaring arrays or similar structures, but within a single-line conditional statement, it's unnecessary.

If I change `[` to `{` and `]` to `}`, that might fix the syntax error. Let me try rewriting the code:

Original line:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Change brackets to braces:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, after the if condition's closing parenthesis, we start the block with `{`, and then close it before the `else` clause. The extra `]` at the end is also removed.

Another thing to check: in some languages like JavaScript, square brackets can be used for declaring arrays inside an if statement, but here it seems like they're not intended to create a new array or object. So using curly braces makes more sense and avoids any confusion with block structures.

So by replacing `[` with `{` and `]` with `}`, the code should compile without syntax errors because we're correctly enclosing the statements within the if condition.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
