Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, so there's an issue with the closing brackets here.

Looking at the code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I notice that it's using 《 and 》 instead of the usual < and >. Maybe those are causing some confusion. Also, after the else statement, there's another 》 which doesn't seem right.

So, first step: replace the 《 with < because in an if-else block, we use < for both conditions. Then check where that extra 》 is coming from. It looks like it's closing two brackets at once, but only one should be needed after else.

I think the correct structure should have a single condition on each line. So instead of having the 'a = 1;' inside a separate bracket, it should be part of the if condition followed by the else clause without an extra bracket afterward.

So rewriting the code: if (x > 0) < a = 1; </ is not right because we shouldn't close before else. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me step back. The original code has two closing brackets: one after the if condition and another at the end of the line. That's probably incorrect because an else statement doesn't need a closing bracket unless part of another structure, which isn't the case here.

So correcting that, the code should be:

if (x > 0) < a = 1; </> is wrong again. Wait, no. The initial thought was to replace 《 with <, but maybe it's not necessary if we're just using standard brackets.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to use angle brackets for some reason, like in a specific context such as JSP or something else where you need escaping. But in plain JavaScript, that wouldn't make sense. So maybe they were using them instead of regular brackets by mistake.

Alternatively, if we're dealing with HTML syntax within the code, perhaps those are being interpreted differently, leading to the error.

But given the error message is about an unexpected '》' after else clause, I think the problem is that there's a closing bracket (》) where it shouldn't be. So removing that would fix the issue.

Putting it all together: change 《 to < and remove the extra 》 at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax errors due to incorrect use of angle brackets. The error message indicates an unexpected '》' after the else clause, suggesting a misplaced closing bracket. The original code uses 《 instead of regular < for the if condition and then another 》 which is causing confusion.

Replacing 《 with < (to match standard JS) and removing the extra 》 will fix both syntax issues:

```javascript
if (x > 0) < a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Here, `else` is properly placed after `if`, and all brackets are correctly closed.

Fixed code:
```javascript
if (x > 0) < a = 1; else b = 2;
```
