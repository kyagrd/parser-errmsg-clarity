Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the code might not be from a specific language like C, Java, or Python, but it's using some symbols. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I see an if statement here with a condition checking if x is greater than 0. Then there's this @ symbol followed by a=1, and then some comments using #.

First thought: In many programming languages, the if statement ends with a semicolon, which this code has after the else clause. But wait, in the given code, after the if block, there are two separate statements: one inside the if condition and another outside as an else. That doesn't make sense because each if-else structure should have its own body.

Looking at the code, I notice that the @ symbol is used here. In some contexts, like in LaTeX or maybe a specific scripting language, @ might be part of a command or something else. But in typical programming languages, it's not a valid keyword after an if statement.

Wait, perhaps this code is using JavaScript? Because in ES6, you can have arrow functions and other syntax, but I don't see that here. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for 'else', where the @ was accidentally used instead of something else, like 'else' itself. But since it's part of the code as given, I have to work with that.

Also, there are two separate lines after the if statement: one is @a=1; and the other is # else b=2;. The # might be a comment start, but in JavaScript, single-line comments start with //. So maybe those are meant to be part of the code. But putting them right after without being within an else block would cause syntax errors.

So perhaps the issue is that the else clause isn't properly closed or structured. Let me think about how to structure this correctly.

In JavaScript, for example, you'd write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the given code, it's written without braces and using ; instead of line breaks after each statement. So maybe the problem is that there are two separate statements: one inside if, another as an else, but they're not properly grouped.

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to write a ternary operator or something else with @, but I'm not sure about that.

Another possibility is that the code was intended for a different language where @ has a specific meaning. For example, in some languages like PHP, you can use @ as an alternate keyword for isset() when using array access, but here it's used outside of that context.

But regardless, looking at the syntax error, the main issue seems to be incorrect usage of keywords and lack of proper scoping.

So perhaps the fix is to correct the else part. Since in JavaScript, you can't have two statements after an if without some kind of structure or braces.

Looking back at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I think that between the if condition and the else, there's a missing brace. But since it's not provided, maybe just adding correct syntax around the statements would help.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing the @ with something else, like 'else', but I'm not sure. Or maybe the code is using some custom syntax elsewhere where @ has a specific meaning.

Wait, in the error message, it says to fix the syntax error using only the provided error message and available symbols. So looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I notice that after 'else', there's another comment starting with # but without braces or proper indentation.

So perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that each statement inside if and else has its own block, using braces. But since I don't know the language, maybe adding braces would help.

But in some languages like JavaScript, you can write:

if (x > 0) {
    @ a = 1;
} else {
    # b = 2;
}

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in JavaScript, '#' is not valid. So perhaps the user meant to use another keyword instead of '#'.

Alternatively, maybe the 'else' was supposed to be part of an if-else construct without braces.

So perhaps the correct code should group the two statements under the if and else clauses correctly.

Wait, let me think again. The original code has:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

This seems like it's trying to write something that might be an inline conditional assignment or maybe part of a different construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use ternary operator but used if-else instead. But I'm not sure.

Given all this, perhaps the main issue is that there are two separate statements after the if condition without proper scoping, causing a syntax error. So adding braces might fix it if we're in a language like JavaScript where that's allowed.

But given the user said to use only symbols from the error message and available ones, maybe replacing '@' with something else, but I'm not sure what. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using another language where @ is valid after an if statement, but more likely, it's a typo or incorrect syntax.

Wait, in PHP, for example, you can use @ as part of variable assignment when checking isset(), like:

if (@a == 1) { ... }

But that's not exactly what's here. So perhaps the user meant to write something else, but due to a typo used '@'.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be 'else', but the @ is leftover.

So considering all this, I think the main fix is to properly scope the statements under if and else by adding braces or correct syntax that groups them. Since braces aren't shown in the code, perhaps adding them would help.

But since the user only wants symbols from the error message (syntax error) and available ones, maybe just correcting the missing semicolon after else? Wait no, but the initial code ends with ; on both if and else parts, which might be causing issues.

Wait, looking back:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

So the structure is: if condition, then statement, then comment as else clause, another statement, ending with ;. That's invalid because in most languages, each statement inside an if must be properly enclosed.

Thus, to fix it, perhaps we should group them within braces or ensure that they are part of a correct syntax.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant to write something like:

if (x > 0) {
    @a = 1;
} else {
    #b = 2;
}

But in JavaScript, # isn't valid. So perhaps changing '#' to ';' but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the code again, after 'else', there's a comment starting with # which is intended as an else statement? Or maybe it's part of another block.

I think the correct approach is to ensure that if-else statements are properly enclosed in braces and each statement under them ends correctly. So perhaps adding braces around both statements.

But since I'm not sure about the exact language, but given the error message, which just says syntax error, the main issue is missing scoping or incorrect use of keywords like @ where it shouldn't be.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to improper usage of the `@` symbol and lack of proper scoping with braces. The correct approach is to properly enclose the statements within if-else conditions using braces.

```javascript
if (x > 0) {
    @a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

However, given that `@` might not be a valid keyword in JavaScript for this context, it's possible the intended code was different. If assuming another language where `@` is acceptable:

```javascript
if (x > 0) @a = 1; else @b = 2;
```

But since braces are needed around if-else blocks, combining both fixes.

Answer:
if (x > 0) {
    @ a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Alternatively, using proper if statement syntax without the comment:

if (x > 0) { @a = 1; } else { #b = 2; }

But considering clarity and assuming braces are needed:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { 
    @ a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Answer: if (x > 0) { @a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But to match the user's instruction and assuming `@` is correct, perhaps:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else # b = 2;

Wait, but in JavaScript, that would be invalid. So better to use braces.

Final Answer:
if (x > 0) { 
    @a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But given the user's instruction to fix using only error message symbols and available ones:

The correct code is likely using braces for if-else, so the final answer would be:

if (x > 0) { 
    @ a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2; 
}

But since in JavaScript `@` might not be valid after an if statement. Therefore, perhaps it's better to adjust as per another language.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant to use 'else', so replacing '@' with something else or removing it:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Thus, the fixed code without using @ is:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}

But since the error message doesn't indicate that `@` is wrong in this context, perhaps it's acceptable. So final answer:
```javascript
if (x > 0) {@a = 1;} else {@b = 2;}
```
But I'm not sure if @ is allowed here.

Alternatively, considering it's a syntax error due to improper scoping:

The correct code should have braces around the statements under if and else. So assuming that `@` was intended for something else or typo, but given the user instruction, perhaps just adding braces.

Final Answer:
if (x > 0) { 
    @a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2; 
}

But to fix it as per code:

The syntax error is due to missing braces around if-else statements. So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) {@ a = 1;} # else { b = 2; }

Wait, but `#` isn't valid in JS. So perhaps changing that.

Alternatively, removing `@` and using proper syntax:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Thus, the final code is:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```

Answer: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But to include @ as per original, perhaps it's acceptable:

if (x > 0) {@a=1;} else {@b=2;}

But not sure about JS.

Given that, I think the main fix is adding braces. So final Answer:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { 
    @ a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
But I'm uncertain because @ might be invalid in JS.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that the code was supposed to use else without any other keyword:

So final Answer:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }
```

Thus, removing @ and using proper if-else syntax with braces. So the fixed code is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

So that's the answer.

Answer: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
