Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means an extra bracket was opened somewhere and not closed properly. Let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement starts with `(x > 0)` followed by `[ a = 1; ]`. That seems odd because usually, after an if condition in many programming languages, you have the code block inside curly braces `{}`. But here, it's using square brackets `[]` instead of braces, which might be causing confusion.

Then there's the else clause: `else b = 2; ]`. Again, it ends with a semicolon and then another closing bracket `]`, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe the code is trying to use square brackets for something else, like an array or list, but in this context, it doesn't make sense.

So let me break down the structure:

1. The if condition: `(x > 0)` — that looks fine.
2. Then `[ a = 1; ]` — I think this is supposed to be the code block for when x>0, so maybe replacing `{ ... }`.
3. Then `else b = 2; ]` — here, the else ends with a semicolon and then another `]`. But in most languages, each statement ends with a semicolon, but for if-else blocks, they usually don't need extra brackets after the condition.

Wait, maybe the issue is that there are two closing brackets at the end: one from the else's code block and an extra one somewhere. Or perhaps the square brackets were intended as part of the code block inside the if statement.

But looking back, in many languages like JavaScript or Python, you use `{}` for blocks after if statements, not `[ ]`. So using `[]` here is incorrect because they aren't valid syntax for that purpose. The correct approach would be to replace them with curly braces `{}`.

So let's try changing the code:

Original: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

Change square brackets to curly braces:
`if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`

Wait, but then I removed the extra closing bracket at the end. The original code had `else b = 2; ]`, so maybe there was an extra closing bracket after that.

Alternatively, perhaps the square brackets were intended to be part of some array or list on the same line as the if statement's body. But in standard syntax, you can't have `[ a=1; ]` directly after `if (x>0)` without braces.

Another possibility is that the code was meant to use a ternary operator or something similar, but it doesn't look like it here because there's an else clause.

So the main issues are:
- Using square brackets instead of curly braces for the if block.
- Having an extra closing bracket at the end after `else b=2;`.

By replacing `[ ]` with `{ }`, and removing the extra `]` at the end, we fix both syntax errors. Now the code should compile without issues because it uses proper block syntax.

Let me write the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, each statement is properly enclosed within curly braces after if and else, and there are no extra closing brackets. The semicolon at the end of the last statement remains as it should.
...done thinking.

The error was caused by using square brackets `[]` instead of curly braces `{}` for code blocks in an `if` statement, along with having an extra closing bracket `]`. Replacing `[ a = 1; ]` with `{ a = 1; }` and removing the trailing `]` fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
