Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet here: 

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And there's an error message saying "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong.

Looking at the code, it starts with an if statement: if (x > 0) followed by [. Then inside, there's a semicolon and then ] else... Wait, that doesn't look right. Oh, I see! After the if block closes with ], there's an else clause. But in the original code, after the if condition, it's written as [a = 1; ] else b=2;]. So maybe the structure is messed up.

I think this might be part of a programming language that uses curly braces for blocks, like JavaScript or Java. In those languages, you don't use square brackets for code blocks. Instead, you use curly braces { and }. So in the original code, they used [ and ] instead of { and }, which is incorrect.

So the line if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b=2;] has two issues: first, using square brackets where curly braces should be, and second, an extra closing bracket that's not needed.

Let me break it down:

1. The if statement starts with { usually, so replacing [ with { makes sense.
2. The code inside the if block is a = 1; which ends with ;, then ] closes the if block. But since we're using curly braces, this should be { and }, not [ and ]. So that's one fix: replace [ with { and ] remains as it is because in this case, maybe only the opening bracket was wrong.
3. Then there's else b=2; but after the if block, which closes with ], then another ;, so the code seems to have an extra ] at the end.

Wait, looking again: The original code ends with ] else... So perhaps the structure is:

if (x > 0)[a =1;] else b=2;

Which would mean after the if block's closing bracket, there's an else clause. But that's not correct because in languages like JavaScript, the else should be outside of any braces.

Wait no, maybe it's more likely that they're using a different syntax where the if-else is part of the same line without proper blocks. So perhaps the code was intended to be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

In that case, the original code has [ and ] instead of { and }, causing a syntax error because it's expecting more.

So, to fix it:

- Replace [ with { in the if condition line.
- Also, there's an extra closing bracket at the end after else, which is not needed. So remove that last ].

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

So in the original code, the user wrote [a =1;] and then another ; before ], but since they're using square brackets instead of curly braces, that's incorrect. So by changing those to curly braces and removing the extra closing bracket, it should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code incorrectly uses square brackets for an if statement in a language where curly braces are expected. Additionally, there is an extra closing bracket which needs to be removed.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:

- Replaced `[` with `{` as square brackets are not used in this context.
- Removed the trailing `]` at the end of the line to correct the syntax error.
