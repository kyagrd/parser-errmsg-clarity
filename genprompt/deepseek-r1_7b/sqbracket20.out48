Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned a mistake and gave an example where they can't use their existing language knowledge beyond what's in the error message. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that this looks like some kind of conditional statement, maybe inspired by a language like JavaScript or something similar because I see the if-else structure. But the syntax here doesn't look right.

The error message is "syntax error," which means there's an issue with how the code is structured. Let me check each part.

Starting from the beginning: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

Wait, in many languages like JavaScript or PHP, after the if condition, you have brackets to wrap the statements. So something like (x>0)[...]. But looking at this code, it's written as (x>0)[, which seems off.

I think the user might be trying to write an array or object structure where each condition corresponds to a value. For example, in JavaScript, you can have an object with conditions, but I'm not sure if that's what they're aiming for here.

Looking closer at the code: after the if condition, it has [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. Wait, the else is outside of the brackets. That might be causing issues because in languages like JavaScript, the else must belong to the last if statement or match correctly with the opening bracket.

So perhaps the mistake is that the code is using square brackets where it shouldn't, or maybe the structure is wrong. Let me think about how this should look.

In some contexts, especially in certain scripting languages, you can have an array of functions or expressions that get called based on conditions. Maybe each condition has a corresponding function or value.

So perhaps the code should be restructured to have each if-else block properly closed and opened with brackets. Let me try to reconstruct it.

If I take the structure from JavaScript's ternary operators, but maybe in this context, they're using square brackets for some array-like conditions. So perhaps the correct way is:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But without the curly braces, if it's supposed to be more like an array or something else.

Wait, in JavaScript, you can have objects with bracket expressions, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to use square brackets for function calls or array indexing. But I think the main issue is that the code is missing braces around each block after if and else.

So putting it all together, the original code has two issues: one is an extra closing bracket at the end, which isn't necessary if we don't have a corresponding opening. The other is probably missing braces or brackets to enclose each statement under if and else.

Alternatively, maybe they're using square brackets as part of a syntax that expects them to be properly nested with commas or something else, but I'm not certain without knowing the exact language's rules.

So considering all this, the corrected code should have proper structure. If it's intended to be an if-else block in JavaScript, then adding braces would fix the syntax. Alternatively, if they're using square brackets for another purpose, maybe replacing them with parentheses and adjusting the structure accordingly.

But since I can't know exactly what language or syntax this is based on beyond the error message, I'll assume it's similar to JavaScript and that each block after if and else needs braces.

So, rewriting the code:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That should fix the syntax errors. The extra ] at the end was probably causing an issue because it had no matching opening bracket.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to mismatched brackets and missing braces for conditional blocks. By adding proper braces after each condition, we ensure correct syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The corrected code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, the user's original code had `[` and `]`, so perhaps they wanted to use square brackets for array-like access. However, without more context, adding braces is safer.

Final answer:

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But since the user mentioned not using pre-trained knowledge and based on the error message, another approach could be removing extra brackets:

The correct code would have if-else without the square brackets.

So perhaps it's intended to use ternary-like syntax. So maybe:

if (x > 0) => a = 1; else => b = 2;

But in JavaScript, that's not valid syntax for assignment expressions outside of expressions like return or in object/array literals.

Alternatively, using proper braces is the safest fix.

So final answer as per above: 

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But to strictly follow user's code structure with brackets:

Perhaps replacing square brackets with parentheses and adjusting logic.

Wait, looking back at the user’s code:
Original code was:
if (x>0) [ a=1; ] else b=2; ]

So maybe they were trying to write if (x > 0) then a = 1, else b=2. So perhaps the correct syntax is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else { b = 2 }

Alternatively, in some languages you can have it as an array:

[ x>0 ? 1 : 2 ]

But that's different.

Wait, but looking again at their code:
Original was if (x>0) [ a=1; ] else b=2; ]

So the first part is inside square brackets. Maybe they meant to write (x>0)[0] = 1; else[0] =2;

But that's more of an array index approach.

Alternatively, maybe it was intended as:

if ((x > 0) [ a = 1; ]) else b = 2; ]

But that doesn't make much sense in most languages. Alternatively, perhaps the code is meant to be:

((x>0))[a=1;] else b=2;

Which also isn’t correct.

Wait, maybe they are using square brackets for function calls with parameters.

Alternatively, thinking outside of JavaScript, perhaps it's a different syntax where if (x > 0)[a = 1; ] is meant to set the value based on condition. But that might not make sense without braces.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. The main issue is that in most languages, after an if-else statement, you need to have a block with braces or parentheses.

So given the user's instruction to use only symbols from the error message (syntax error) and available symbols like [ ] { }, probably adding braces was the correct fix. So I'll provide that as the answer.

Final code:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So in triple backticks, it's:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But the user originally had [ and ] so perhaps they wanted that structure. Alternatively, if using ternary operator-like syntax, but without more context, braces are safest.

Therefore, I think the correct fixed code is:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So final answer inside triple backticks as requested: 

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}
```

But to match the user's original brackets, it would be:

Original had:
if (x>0) [ a=1; ] else b=2; ]

So perhaps replacing with {}.

Thus, final code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But to keep the user's bracket style but correct it:

Alternatively, maybe using colons for object literals. For example: 

{ if(x>0): {a=1}, else: {b=2} }

But that's more of a LINQ syntax.

So perhaps another approach is needed. But without knowing the exact language, braces are safest.
</think>

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The corrected code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But to match the structure with braces, as per the error message:

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}
```

Final code inside triple backticks:

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
