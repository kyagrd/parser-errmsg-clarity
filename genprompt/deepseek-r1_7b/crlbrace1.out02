Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again. 

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, I see that there's an if statement checking if x is greater than 0. Inside the curly braces, they're assigning a=1. Then there's an else clause right after another curly brace: `else b = 2; }`. Wait, but look at how many curly braces there are.

The if block has one opening { and one closing }, so that's correct. Then the else is next, followed by `b=2;`, and then a closing }. But wait, the if statement only had one brace pair, so after the else, we shouldn't have another brace unless it's part of the same level as the if.

Oh right! The structure should be: if { ... } else { ... }. So in this code, after the if block closes with }, the else is outside of that. But then, do they want the else to have its own block? Because currently, the else doesn't have a closing brace until the very end.

So maybe the error is because there's an extra closing brace at the end that doesn't match any opening brace for the else statement. Let me check: The code has:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

That's two opening curly braces after if and else, but only one closing. So the last } is trying to close something that doesn't exist because there was no matching {. It should be fixed so that the else either has its own block or not.

Looking back at the code, maybe they intended for the else statement to have a value assigned without an explicit block. Alternatively, perhaps the else clause should be part of the if's block but with its own condition. 

Wait, in the original code, after the if {a=1; }, then it's followed by } else b=2;. So that would mean the else is at the same level as the if statement, not inside the if block. But without braces around the else part, which can happen but might cause confusion.

So maybe the error is because of an extra closing brace at the end. Let me count: 

The code has:
- One { after if
- Then a=1;
- Then } to close the if block
- Then else b=2;
- Then another }

Wait, no, looking again:

The code as written is: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

So after the if's }, then there's an 'else' and the assignment to b. Then another }. But wait, that would mean that after the else statement, which doesn't have braces, it ends with }, but since the else is not inside any block except at the top level.

Wait, maybe the code is trying to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

Which would require two closing braces: one after if and another after else. But in the given code, there's only one closing brace after else, but wait no, let me check again.

No, looking at the code:

After the if block closes with }, then 'else' is written, followed by b=2; and then a } which would close something that doesn't exist because we're already outside any blocks.

Wait, perhaps the structure is incorrect. The correct way would be either to have braces for both if and else:

if (x>0) { 
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

Or alternatively, without braces around else:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

In this case, the original code is missing an opening brace after else. Let me see: 

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So it's like:

- if (condition) { ... } else statement;
But without braces around the else part.

Wait, no, actually, in this case, after the if block closes with }, then 'else' is at the same level. So perhaps they intended to have an else clause but forgot to open a brace for it, leading to the syntax error because of the extra }.

So to fix it, we can either:

1. Add braces around the else statement: `if (x>0) {a=1; } else {b=2;}`
But that would require two opening and closing braces.

Or

2. Remove the last }, so the code becomes:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Because the else statement doesn't need its own block if it's just one line, or they might have wanted to close both the if and else blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is because of an extra } after else. Let me check:

The code as written has two statements: inside the if, then else b=2;. But with only one }, which would cause a syntax error at the end because there's no matching { for that last }.

Wait, let me count the number of opening and closing braces:

- The first { is opened in 'a = 1;'.
- Then after that, the code has } else b=2; }

So that's one }, then else..., but wait, perhaps it's better to write:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

Without any braces. So no { or } for the if statement except around 'a=1;' and adding an extra brace at the end.

Alternatively, maybe they wanted the else to have its own block but forgot to add the opening brace after else.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is:

if (x>0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Which would require two closing braces: one at the end of if's block and another at the end of else's block. But in this case, the original code only has one } after else.

Wait no, looking again:

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So that would have two opening braces: first at 'a=1;', then another after 'else' which isn't correct because you can't have an } for the second brace without matching.

Wait, maybe it's better to just remove the last }, so the code becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Which would fix the error by removing the extra }.
...done thinking.

The original code has an unexpected closing curly brace which causes a syntax error. By adding braces around the `else` clause, we ensure proper scoping.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
