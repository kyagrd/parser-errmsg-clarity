Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I know that there's an error here, so I need to figure out what's wrong and how to correct it.

First, looking at the if statement: "if (x > 0) {" This part seems fine. It checks if x is greater than zero and then does something inside the curly braces.

Next, there's an else clause written as "else b = 2;". Wait, that doesn't look right. The correct syntax for an else statement should be followed by another block of code within curly braces, like else { ... }. So instead of just 'else b=2;', it should be "else { b = 2; }".

Also, I notice the semicolon after the if's opening brace and at the end of the else part. The initial code ends with a single closing brace without matching the opening one, which is another issue. So the structure isn't properly closed.

Putting this together, the corrected code should have the else statement inside its own curly braces and close correctly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
