Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code and the error message. The error is a "syntax error," which usually means there's something wrong with the structure of the code that Python doesn't recognize.

Looking at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see an if statement followed by some conditions. The first line inside the if is written as "[ a = 1; ]", which seems off. In Python, within an if block, you typically write indented code blocks. So maybe that's part of the problem.

Wait, actually, looking closer, it looks like someone tried to use a multi-line string or something else with brackets, but in Python, the indentation and syntax are strict. Also, I notice that after the else clause, there's another ] which doesn't seem right because each if-else block should be properly indented.

So breaking it down:

1. The code starts with an if statement: if (x > 0) 
2. Then inside what seems to be the condition, there's [ a = 1; ]
3. Then else b = 2;
4. And then another ]

The first issue is that within an if block in Python, you can't have square brackets like that without proper context. Maybe it was intended to create some kind of list or dictionary, but I don't see how.

Also, the closing ] at the end might be causing a problem because each bracket should be properly closed and indented. Let me count the opening and closing brackets:

- The if statement starts with (x > 0), which is a condition inside parentheses, so that's fine.
- Then there's [ a = 1; ], but in Python, you don't put code inside square brackets unless it's part of a list or another data structure. So this seems incorrect.

Maybe the user intended to write an if-else block with proper indentation and maybe some inline expressions? Like using a ternary operator?

Wait, perhaps they were trying to use something like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in their code, it's missing the colons after the if and else statements. Oh wait, looking again, I see that the original code has semicolons instead of colons for if and else conditions.

Wait no, actually, in Python, you write:

if condition:
    pass
else:
    pass

So they should have a colon after if and else, not semicolons.

But also, inside the if block, the way they wrote [ a = 1; ] is wrong. Maybe it's supposed to be an indented block. So perhaps the correct code would be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

So putting that together, I'll fix the syntax by replacing the square brackets with proper indentation and colons.

Let me check again: in their code, after if (x>0), they have [a=1;], which is incorrect. So removing those brackets and indenting the code properly should fix it.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to improper use of square brackets and lack of proper indentation for multi-line statements.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The `if` statement in Python requires that any indented block (like the one inside) must be correctly aligned under the condition.
2. The line `[ a = 1; ]` is incorrect syntax because it doesn't follow proper Python syntax rules and uses square brackets unnecessarily when defining a new indented block.
3. Adding `:` after `if` and `else`, along with correct indentation, fixes the structure.

The corrected code:

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
