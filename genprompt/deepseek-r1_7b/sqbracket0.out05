Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code again: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. Hmm, the user mentioned that the error is a syntax error, and they provided the code with specific formatting.

I remember that when using square brackets for arrays or conditions in some languages like JavaScript, you have to declare them properly. Wait, no, maybe it's not JavaScript here. Looking at the code again, I see an if statement followed by a condition where [ is used. That doesn't look right.

In programming, inside an if block, we use braces { } for the statements. So instead of using square brackets around 'a = 1;', that might be causing the issue because it's not valid syntax. Also, I notice there's another ] at the end without a matching opening bracket. That probably causes a mismatched brackets error.

So, let me break it down:

The original code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I think the problem starts with using square brackets in place of braces for the if block. So I should replace [ and ] with { and } respectively.

Also, there's an extra closing bracket at the end which doesn't have a corresponding opening bracket inside the if statement. That's why it's causing a syntax error because the brackets are mismatched.

So fixing that would mean changing:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

to

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript, the structure might be different. However, given the error is just syntax and not specifying the language, I'll assume braces are needed.

Alternatively, if this was intended for an array or another construct that uses square brackets, maybe it's a misunderstanding. But since inside an if statement, using { } is standard to denote code blocks, so that makes sense.

So putting it all together, replacing [ with { and ] with }, removing the extra ], and ensuring each block has matching braces.
...done thinking.

The original code had mismatched square brackets where curly braces were required for block statements. Here's the fixed version:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

The final answer is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
