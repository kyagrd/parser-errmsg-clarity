Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error" and the code that's supposed to be corrected is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first, I notice that there are some angle brackets 《 》 being used instead of regular parentheses. In programming, especially in languages like C or Java, we use regular parentheses () for if statements and conditions. Using angle brackets might be a mistake here.

Looking at the code structure: The user wrote "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". It seems like they're trying to close the if block with 《 and then again with 》, which doesn't look right. Maybe they intended to use regular parentheses.

So I think the correct approach is to replace all the angle brackets (《 and 》) with regular parentheses (). Also, looking at the code inside, after the else statement, there's an extra 》 at the end. That should be removed because it doesn't belong.

Putting it together: The if condition remains as is, using parentheses. Then, inside the true block, a=1; and in the false block, b=2. So the corrected code should have regular parentheses without any angle brackets or extra closing braces.
...done thinking.

The original code uses angle brackets (《 》) instead of regular parentheses () for the if statement condition, which is incorrect syntax.

Here's the fixed code:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Incorrect Characters:** The code uses angle brackets `《` and `》` instead of regular parentheses.
2. **Correct Parentheses Usage:** Replace all angle brackets with regular parentheses `()` to match the expected syntax for if statements in most programming languages.
3. **Remove Extra Closing Bracket:** There's an extra closing bracket at the end, which isn't needed after the else statement.

The corrected code now follows proper syntax and is syntactically valid.
