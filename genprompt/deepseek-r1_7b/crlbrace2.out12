Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this syntax error. The code given is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. Hmm, so I need to figure out where that extra brace is.

Looking at the code, the if statement starts with if (x>0) and has a single curly brace opening. Then inside, it has a=1;. The else part follows without any braces. So the structure seems like:

if (...) { ... } else ...
But wait, in most languages, each else must be paired with an if. But here, after the else, there's no opening brace, but then another }. So maybe the braces are mismatched.

Let me count the braces. The outer if has one {. Then inside, a=1; ends it. Then } else... which is probably incorrect because the else doesn't have its own block unless specified with {}.

Wait, in some languages like JavaScript or similar, you can write else without braces and just assign to b=2. But looking at the code, after the if's }, there's an else followed by a semicolon and then another } which is probably the end of the outer if block, causing an error because it's expecting more.

So the issue is that the else statement isn't properly closed or matched with braces where needed. The correct structure should be either:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Or in a way that doesn't require braces for single statements, like in JavaScript:

if (x>0) {a=1} else b=2;

Wait, but the error message is about an unexpected '}', so perhaps adding braces around the else part would fix it. Alternatively, maybe removing unnecessary braces when possible.

In the original code, after the if's }, there's an else without a block and then another }. So that extra } is causing the problem because it closes the outer if statement prematurely.

So to fix it, I should ensure all blocks are properly opened and closed with matching braces. Either add braces around the else part or adjust where the braces are placed.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace which causes a syntax error. The correct structure is to have either braces for conditional statements unless they contain single-line statements.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Alternatively, without adding extra braces:

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1} else b = 2;
```
