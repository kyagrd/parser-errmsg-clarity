Thinking...
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some Python code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error" and the code that's problematic. Let me look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I know that in Python, `if` statements can't have comments right after them without some space or another statement. Also, there's something about not having an indentation where it's expected.

Wait, looking at the code again, after the `if (x > 0)` line, they have `@ a = 1; #`. That semicolon might be causing issues because in Python, you don't end lines with semicolons. Oh wait, no—Python actually uses colons for blocks and doesn't use semicolons to terminate statements like other languages. So the semicolon there is unnecessary.

Then they have `else b = 2; #` right after another semicolon. That's a problem because in Python, an `else` clause should come directly after the `if`, without any extra lines or comments unless properly indented.

So putting it all together, I think the code has two main issues: one is having extraneous semicolons and comments at the end of lines, which aren't valid in Python. The other issue is probably a formatting problem where the `else` isn't correctly placed with an indentation or without extra characters.

I should remove those semicolons and comments. Also, since it's an if-else structure, I need to make sure that each condition has proper indentation so Python knows what block goes with which line.

So the corrected code would be:

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

This way, there are no semicolons at the end of lines after keywords like `if` or `else`, and everything is properly indented for Python to parse correctly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
