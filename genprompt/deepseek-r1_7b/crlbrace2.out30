Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, breaking this down. The if statement starts with "if (x>0) {" which makes sense—checking if x is greater than zero and then executing some code inside the curly braces. Then there's an else clause right after it: "else b=2;" but wait, that doesn't have any curly braces around it. So in most programming languages like C or Java, the else statement should be followed by a block enclosed in braces.

Looking at the error message again: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). It seems like there's an extra closing brace somewhere. Let me count the braces here.

The if condition has one opening brace and then inside it's "a=1;". Then, outside of that block, the else is written as "else b=2;" without any braces. So after that, there's another closing brace before the semicolon at the end. Wait, no—the code ends with a semicolon after "else b=2;", so actually, in this case, the else statement doesn't have its own block.

So when you write it like this:

if (x>0) {a=1; } else b=2; }

The parser sees that after the else, there's another closing brace before the semicolon. But since the if statement already closed with the first }, that second } is causing an issue because it doesn't have a matching block for the else.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that each curly brace is properly matched and closed after its corresponding opening. So in this case, both the if and else statements should have their own blocks.

So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but looking at that, the else is followed by a block with braces. Also, I notice there's an extra closing brace in the original code after else, which might have caused confusion.

Alternatively, maybe just add the curly braces around the else part to make it a proper statement.

So putting it all together, the fixed code would include adding the curly braces for both if and else.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
