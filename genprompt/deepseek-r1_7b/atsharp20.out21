Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and gave some code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that the code has some strange characters: @ and #. In many programming languages like C or Java, these symbols have specific meanings. The @ symbol isn't used for assignment in those languages, so maybe it's causing a syntax issue.

Looking at the code structure, there are two if-else blocks separated by the @ and #: one where x is greater than 0 sets a=1, and another where else b=2. But this doesn't make much sense because each condition should have its own body. Also, using ; after each line might not be correct in some contexts.

I recall that in languages like C, an if statement ends with a semicolon, but the code inside the braces is indented and must follow proper syntax. So perhaps the original code was trying to write two separate assignments within an if-else structure but didn't format it correctly.

Wait, maybe the user intended to have an if statement that checks if x > 0, then sets a=1; else, sets b=2;. But in C or similar languages, you can't have multiple statements without braces. So perhaps they're using a different syntax where they don't need braces and just use semicolons.

But looking at the code again, it's written as two separate lines after the if condition: @a = 1; # else b=2;. That doesn't make sense because @ isn't an assignment operator. So maybe the user meant to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But without braces, in some languages you can use semicolons and line breaks for block scope, but it's not standard everywhere.

Wait, perhaps they're using a language where they don't need braces and can just write the statements on separate lines. So maybe removing the @ and # symbols would fix the syntax.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But I'm not sure about the semicolons at the end of each line. In C, you don't need semicolons after if-else statements because they are compound statements, but in some other languages like JavaScript, it's required.

Alternatively, maybe the original code was written without braces and using semicolons for block scope, so adding a semicolon before else would fix it.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to have:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But in that case, there's no need for the @ and # symbols. So maybe those were meant to be removed.

Putting it all together, I think removing the @ and # and adjusting the structure would fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to incorrect use of `@` and `#`. These are not valid in C-like languages. The corrected code uses proper assignment operators within if-else blocks without semicolons.

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Removed the `@` and `#` symbols as they are not part of C syntax.
2. Structured the code correctly with if-else blocks, assigning values to variables within each condition.

Final answer: 

```c
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
