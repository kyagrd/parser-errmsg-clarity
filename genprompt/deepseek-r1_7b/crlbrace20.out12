Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out why it's causing a syntax error. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error, so something's wrong with the structure of the code.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces `}` at the end. In most programming languages, each block should be properly closed before moving on. Let me count them: the if statement has one opening brace `{` and then another after else, making it two in total. But the code ends with only one `}`, so that's a problem. The last } might not be matching correctly.

Wait, looking closer, maybe the structure is off. If I break it down:

- `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` — this looks okay.
- Then there's an `else b = 2; }` — but that else should have its own block. So perhaps the code has an extra closing brace.

Alternatively, maybe the if statement and else are both supposed to be in their own braces. Let me think about how it should look:

A correct structure would be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

So that means each condition has its own closing brace, and the code ends with another `}` after the else block. In the original code, there's an extra } at the end which isn't needed because the if-else is covered.

Wait, in the original code, it's written as:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So after the else statement, there's another `}`. But that second `}` might be causing an issue because if the else doesn't have its own block, it could close prematurely.

Alternatively, maybe the code is missing a brace after the else clause. So I should adjust it to include the braces for each condition.

So putting it all together, I'll fix the syntax by adding braces around both conditions and removing the extra closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
