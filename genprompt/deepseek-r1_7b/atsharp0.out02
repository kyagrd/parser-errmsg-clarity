Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's see what the problem is.

The code provided is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And the error message says there's a syntax error. Hmm, okay.

First, I notice that the if statement has an @ operator after it. That doesn't look right. In Python, the @ symbol is used for decorators, but in this context, it's not applicable inside an if condition. So maybe that's causing the issue.

Next, looking at the code structure, there are some lines with comments using # which might interfere with how the code is parsed. Also, after the if statement, there's a # else... line. But Python doesn't support multi-line conditional statements in the same way as other languages, so having an else on a separate line isn't correct.

I think the main issues are:
1. The @ symbol inside the if condition.
2. The placement of the else clause on a new line without proper indentation or structure.

So, to fix this, I should remove the @ symbol because it's not needed here. Also, combine the conditions correctly using logical operators like and or or in Python. Since they're separate conditions, maybe an elif would be appropriate if there are multiple checks.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) else b = 2

This way, if x is greater than 0, a gets assigned 1; otherwise, b gets assigned 2. I removed the @ and structured the conditions properly without any unnecessary comments or line breaks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) else b = 2
```
