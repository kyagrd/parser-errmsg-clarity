Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's a "syntax error" when they run the code. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, okay, first off, I know that if-else statements in JavaScript typically end with semicolons or sometimes without if it's part of an expression. But here, the line starts with an `if` statement followed by some other code on the same line.

Wait, after the `if (x > 0)` condition, there's an `@ a = 1;` which looks like something from jQuery maybe? Or perhaps a typo for `a = 1;`. Then they have comments using `#`, but in JavaScript, we use `//` or `/* */` for comments. So the code is mixing up different comment styles.

Let me break it down:

1. The line starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. That's correct on its own.
2. Then there's `@ a = 1;` which isn't valid syntax in JavaScript unless it's jQuery shorthand, but that would require selecting elements and assigning values to variables without declaring them. But here, the line is trying to be part of an if statement, so I'm not sure how this fits.
3. Then there's `# else b = 2;` which looks like a comment starting with #, but in JavaScript, that's only for single-line comments between `//` or at the end of lines before semicolons.

Wait, maybe they intended to use an if-else statement correctly, so perhaps the code should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in their current code, they have `@` and mixed comment styles. The error is likely because of these syntax issues: using `@`, which isn't valid in an if statement context, and mixing single-line comments with the rest.

So to fix this, I need to:

- Remove or adjust any invalid syntax.
- Properly structure the if-else block with correct braces `{}` for scoping.
- Correct the comment styles so they are consistent (either using `//` everywhere).

Looking at their code again: The original line is split into two parts. They have:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Which probably should be one if statement with an else clause.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, the `@` is removed because it's not needed in a regular if-else structure. Braces are added to properly encapsulate each block of code within the condition and its else clause.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
