Thinking...
Alright, let's see. I've got this code snippet that needs fixing. The user mentioned there's a syntax error: an unexpected '}' after the else clause. So looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, okay, so the structure is if with a condition, then a block inside curly braces, followed by an else statement and another assignment. But there's an extra closing brace that doesn't match.

Let me break it down. The if statement starts with (x > 0) { ... }, which seems correct because after the parenthesis, we have a block in curly braces. Then comes the else keyword and another assignment: else b = 2; but then there's an extra } at the end.

Wait, so the code is written as:
if (...) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So the if block ends with }, which closes that part. But after the else statement, we have another ; and then a closing brace, which doesn't belong. That's why there's an unexpected '}' error.

I think the issue is that the else statement isn't properly enclosed within braces. In many programming languages, including C-like syntax, each if-else clause should be within its own block. So probably, both the if and else parts need their own curly braces.

So the correct structure would have the if with its block, then an else with its own block. That means after the else statement, we should have another pair of braces for that part.

Let me try rewriting it:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each conditional has its own block. The first if is inside its curly braces, then the else is followed by its own set of braces, which closes after the statement.

So in the original code, the else was not within braces, causing the extra '}' to be unexpected. By adding braces around the else clause, the syntax error should be fixed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
