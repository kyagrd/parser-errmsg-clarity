Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

And the error message is just "syntax error". Hmm, I remember that in programming, especially in languages like C or C++, the ternary operator has specific syntax. It's supposed to be something like `condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;`.

Looking at the code, after the if statement `(x > 0)`, there's an @ symbol followed by a = 1. That doesn't look right because the ternary operator isn't just @; it should have both parts separated by a colon and then the other side.

So I think the problem is that the code is using `@` instead of a colon `:` for separating the conditions in the ternary operator. Also, there's an extra `#` at the end which might be causing another issue or just part of some formatting.

Let me try to rewrite it correctly. The structure should be:
```
if (condition) ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
```

So applying that here, replacing `(x > 0)` with `(x > 0) ?`, and then `a = 1` after the @ was probably meant to be after the colon. Also, removing the extra `#`.

Putting it all together:
```
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```

That should fix the syntax error because now the ternary operator is correctly formatted with the colon and both expressions are properly assigned.
...done thinking.

The code had two issues: the use of `@` instead of a colon for the ternary operator, and an extra `#`. The corrected code uses the proper syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Error:** The original code used `@` instead of a colon in the ternary operator, which is invalid syntax.
   
2. **Correct the Operator:** Replace `@` with `:` to properly separate the expressions in the ternary operator.

3. **Remove Extra Characters:** Remove any additional punctuation like `#` that doesn't belong in this context.

4. **Reconstruct the Code:** Formulate the corrected code using proper syntax for a ternary conditional expression.

The final fixed code is:

```fix
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```
