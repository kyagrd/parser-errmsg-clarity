Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned a syntax error and gave some example code. Let me look at it closely.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, first, I notice that there are two closing curly braces here. One after the if statement and another at the end of the code. That's probably causing an error because each block should have its own braces.

Also, looking at the else part, it's written as `else b = 2;` but in most programming languages like C or Java, you write it without a semicolon after else unless it's part of a statement that requires one. Wait, actually, no—else is a control structure and doesn't need an ending semicolon.

Wait, the code seems to have two closing braces: the first { inside the if statement closes correctly, but then there are two } at the end. So probably, the else block isn't properly closed.

Looking again, after the if condition, we have `{ a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. Oh, I see, so the else is part of the if statement, but it's not enclosed in braces. That might be causing the syntax error because the else doesn't form a complete block.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that both the if and else parts are properly enclosed within their own blocks. So after the if condition, we have an opening brace, then inside the block {a = 1;}, which is correct. Then the else should be followed by its own braces. The original code has } else ..., so maybe it's missing braces for the else part.

Wait, looking again: `if (x >0) { a=1; } else b=2; }`. So after the else, there's no opening brace, and then at the end, another closing brace is present. That means that the if block ends with its own }, but then the code continues, which isn't correct.

So to fix it, I should add an opening brace for the else part and ensure all braces are properly closed. Let me try rewriting it:

After fixing, it should be:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each block is enclosed in its own braces, so there's no syntax error anymore.

Alternatively, if the code were intended to have only one line after else without an explicit block, but given that it's written as `else b=2;`, which usually expects a semicolon and some statement. So adding braces around it makes sense.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
