Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at what's provided.

The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see that there are some issues here. First, the if statement has parentheses around x > 0, which isn't wrong per se, but maybe it's not necessary? Wait, no, in C-like languages, it's common to have parentheses for conditions.

The bigger issue seems to be with the syntax inside the comments or whatever those symbols are. There are two sets of angle brackets: 《 and 》. I'm guessing these are supposed to represent comments, maybe using HTML entities? So instead of regular /* */, they're using 《 and 》 which are similar but not the same.

Looking closer, after the if statement, there's an else clause without a condition, which isn't valid syntax for if-else in C or similar languages. The structure should be:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

So right now, it's written as if (x>0) 《...》 else b=2; 》

The angle brackets are being used incorrectly here because they're not the same as /* */, which is what I'm more familiar with. So perhaps replacing them with /* */ would fix it.

Also, in C-like syntax, after an else statement, you don't need a semicolon unless it's part of a block. Since we only have one line inside each condition, using braces {} can help structure the code properly without confusion.

So putting it all together:

- Replace 《 and 》 with /* */ to make valid comments.
- Wrap each conditional block in braces {} so that the syntax is correct and the code is structured clearly.

That should fix both the syntax error (because of incorrect comments) and the missing condition for else. Also, using braces will prevent any potential confusion about which statements are part of which conditions.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { /* a = 1; */ } else { /* b = 2; */ }
...done thinking.

The original code has syntax errors due to incorrect comment usage and improper structure. The angle brackets (`《` and `》`) are not standard for comments, so they should be replaced with regular C-style comments (`/*` and `*/`). Additionally, the code lacks braces around each block after the if statement, which is necessary for correct parsing.

```fix
if (x > 0) { /* a = 1; */ } else { /* b = 2; */ }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace the incorrect comment syntax (`《` and `》`) with standard C-style comments (`/*` and `*/`).
2. Enclose each conditional statement in braces `{}` to define code blocks correctly.
3. This fixes both the syntax error and ensures the if-else structure is properly formatted.
