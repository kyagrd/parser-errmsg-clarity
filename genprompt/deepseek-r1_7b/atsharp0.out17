Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message that says "syntax error," and they want me to fix it using only the error message without any pre-trained knowledge. Let me look at the code they provided:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I know in programming languages like C or C++, there's something called the ternary operator which is used for conditional expressions. It has a specific syntax: `condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false`. So looking at the code, it starts with an if statement but then uses `@` and `else`, which doesn't make sense in that context.

Wait, maybe the user is trying to use a ternary operator instead of an if-else. In C/C++, you can write:

```
a = (x > 0) ? 1 : 2;
```

But looking at their code, they have `if (...) @ a = 1; # else b=2;`. The `@` isn't recognized as correct syntax for ternary. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding.

So the original line is trying to assign either 1 or 2 based on x>0, but using incorrect operators and syntax. So instead of if-else with semicolons, I should use the ternary operator correctly.

Putting it all together, replacing the if statement with the correct ternary operator:

```
a = (x > 0) ? 1 : 2;
```

That makes sense because if x is greater than 0, a gets 1; else, it gets 2. The semicolons after each part are also corrected to proper line endings in C/C++.
...done thinking.

The code was using incorrect syntax for assigning values conditionally. By replacing the `if` statement with a ternary operator, we can fix the error.

```fix
a = (x > 0) ? 1 : 2;
```

This replaces the original problematic lines, which used an if-else structure incorrectly, and includes proper assignment using the correct syntax for conditional assignments.
