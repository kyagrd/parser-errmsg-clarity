Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The user mentioned that the syntax might be different from languages like C, Java, or Python. So I should think about possible syntax structures.

First, looking at the if statement: "if (x > 0)". That seems okay because it's using parentheses correctly for a condition. Now, after the condition, there's an opening square bracket [ and some code inside, followed by ] else b = 2; ].

Wait, in many languages like JavaScript or PHP, you have different blocks based on conditions. So maybe this is trying to use a ternary operator but it's written incorrectly.

The current structure is:

if (condition) [ ... ] else ...

But that doesn't look right. In some contexts, like using square brackets for arrays, but here it's inside an if statement.

I think the user might be mixing up syntax from different languages. Maybe they're trying to use a ternary operator which in JavaScript is written as: (condition) ? value1 : value2;

So perhaps the code should be rewritten to fit that structure instead of using square brackets and else.

Looking at the original code, it's using [ and ] after if and else. That doesn't make sense because those are for array literals or dictionaries in JavaScript. So I think replacing those with ternary operator syntax would fix the issue.

So let me try rewriting the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, in JavaScript, we can also write it as a single line using the ternary operator without braces if we don't need new lines. Alternatively, keep it with braces for clarity.

So maybe replacing [ ] after if and else with { }, which is correct for block statements.

Another thought: The original code had [a = 1;] inside the if bracket but no opening brace before the else statement. That's causing a syntax error because the else isn't properly associated with an opening block.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to have two separate blocks after each condition. So in that case, using { } for both would make sense.

So putting it all together, the code should be corrected by changing [ ] to { }, and removing unnecessary brackets or colons if they're not part of a ternary operator.
...done thinking.

The syntax error is caused by incorrect block notation after `if` and `else`. The correct way is to use curly braces `{}`.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
