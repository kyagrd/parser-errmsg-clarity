Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where the user provided some code with a syntax error and an error message. The task is to fix the syntax error using only the error message and without relying on pre-trained knowledge. 

The code given is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And the output needs to be fixed inside triple backticks.

First, I notice that in the code block, there are two lines with `#` at the end. That's unusual because typically, each line in an if-else statement should have proper syntax without trailing comments unless intended for documentation.

Looking closer, the first line is "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;". The `@` symbol isn't valid here. I recall that in Python, the `@` is used for decorators or as part of lambda functions. However, in an if statement, it's not correct.

The second line is "# else b = 2; #", which starts with a comment but seems to be intended as another condition. But since this isn't properly indented and doesn't follow the syntax of an if-else block, I think the user might have tried to write something like:

if (x > 0):
    @a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in that case, using `@` inside the code would cause a syntax error because it's not valid Python syntax.

So, the solution is to remove the trailing comments and correct the line with the `@`. Since it's part of an if statement, replacing `@a` with just `a` makes sense. So, the corrected lines should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

I'll make sure to remove the trailing `#` comments because they don't serve any purpose here and would cause syntax errors if left.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
