Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

And the error message says "syntax error." Hmm, I remember that in programming, syntax errors happen when the code doesn't follow the language's rules. So let me look at this line.

First, I notice that there are these fancy brackets: 《 and 》. I'm not sure if they're part of the problem or just stylistic choices here. In C++, for example, we use <> for templates and [] for arrays. But maybe in this context, they were intended to be used as some sort of comment markers? Or perhaps placeholders.

Looking at the structure: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I see that after the if statement, there's an opening bracket 《 which probably shouldn't be there. Then inside it, 'a=1;' is just one line of code, but then there's a closing bracket 》 and another closing brace for the else clause.

Wait, maybe these brackets are supposed to create some kind of block or comment. In C++, we can have comments using // or /* ... */. But here, they're using 《 and 》 which don't seem standard. So perhaps those should be replaced with regular C++ syntax.

So I think the first step is to remove those non-standard brackets. Let me try rewriting that part:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That looks better. The curly braces are used for code blocks in C++, so that's correct. Also, there was an extra closing brace at the end of the line which might be causing another issue.

Looking again, after fixing the brackets, I should check if everything is properly indented and closed. So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

I think that's it. The syntax error was due to the non-standard brackets and an extra closing brace which might have confused the compiler or interpreter. By replacing them with proper C++ syntax, the code should now compile without errors.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax issues because of the use of unusual brackets (《》) instead of standard braces () and an extra closing brace at the end.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Remove the non-standard 《》 brackets since they are not valid in C++.
2. Properly close each block with a single curly brace } to avoid syntax errors.

The fixed code is:
```c++
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
