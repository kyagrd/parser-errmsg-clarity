Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the error message again: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that means there's an unexpected closing symbol here. 

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice that after the else clause, there's another '》' which might be causing the issue. The error says it's unexpected because maybe the parentheses aren't closed correctly.

Wait, I see that the if statement has its condition in parentheses: `(x > 0)`. Then comes `《 a = 1; 》` and after else, another `》`. So perhaps the brackets are misused here. 

I recall that '《' and '》' are often used for Chinese characters or other purposes, but maybe in this context, they're intended to be curly braces `{}` instead. That would make sense because using them inside an if statement without proper nesting might cause issues.

So, I'll replace both '《' with '{' and '》' with '}':
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
Let me check again. The parentheses are correctly closed around the condition. Then inside the if block, we have `a=1;` properly enclosed in curly braces. The else clause now also has its own curly brace closing. That should fix the syntax error.

I think that's it. This should resolve the unexpected '》' after else because I replaced them with proper braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
