Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The user mentioned it's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code they provided.

The code is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Wait, I see something wrong here. First, there are extra angle brackets around the statements. The '《' and '》' aren't necessary because it's within an if statement.

So, looking at the code structure, after the if block, they have an else clause with its own semicolon. But then there's another '》' at the end, which doesn't belong inside the if or else blocks.

I think what's happening is that the user tried to add some kind of brackets around their assignments but ended up closing the bracket too many times. The correct way should be without those extra angle brackets in between.

So, the corrected code would remove the unnecessary '《' and '》' inside each condition. Let me rewrite it:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense. The braces are correctly placed, and the else clause is properly closed before the outer closing brace.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
