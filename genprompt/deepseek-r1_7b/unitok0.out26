Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

First, I notice that there are angle brackets `<` and `>` being used instead of parentheses `( )`. In programming languages like C or Java, angle brackets are often used for generics, but here they're not appropriate. So the first step is to replace those with regular parentheses.

Next, looking at the structure, after the if statement, it's written as:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I see that both branches of the if-else are enclosed within these angle brackets. However, each branch should be properly encapsulated within parentheses or just placed correctly without them. So I think removing those angle brackets around each statement would fix it.

Let me break it down:

1. Replace `<` with `(` and `>` with `)` in both places.
2. Remove the extra angle brackets that are not needed after fixing the parentheses.

So, changing `<` to `(` where they appear at the beginning of the if condition and similarly for the else part might be redundant because conditions usually don't need parentheses around them unless we're combining multiple conditions with logical operators enclosed in parentheses.

But looking at the code again, the structure is:

if (x > 0) [statement1] else [statement2];

So it's more like an if-else statement where each condition has its own block. Therefore, replacing `<` and `>` with parentheses around each statement should correct the syntax.

Wait, no, actually, in this code, both statements are inside angle brackets which is incorrect because those aren't part of the structure here. So I think the issue is that the user used `<` and `>` instead of `( )`. So replacing all of them would fix it.

Let me try rewriting:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But looking at the original code, maybe the intention was to have each statement on its own line without extra braces. So perhaps using semicolons and proper indentation.

Wait, in C-like syntax, you don't need braces around single statements in if-else blocks unless it's a compound condition or multiple statements. Here, both are single statements, so they can be placed directly after the parentheses.

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2;
}

But perhaps without extra spaces and with proper line breaks for readability.

Alternatively, if we don't want to use braces, just place each statement on its own line inside the parentheses.

So:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that should fix the syntax error. So replacing all angle brackets with parentheses and ensuring proper structure.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect use of angle brackets `<` and `>` which are not valid in this context. They should be replaced with regular parentheses `( )`. Additionally, each statement within the if-else block needs to be properly enclosed.

Here is the fixed code:

```c
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2;
}
```

The corrected code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Replace Angle Brackets with Parentheses:** The original code uses `<` and `>` which are incorrect in this context. They should be replaced with regular parentheses `( )`.

2. **Structure the If-Else Block Correctly:** Each statement inside an if or else block should be enclosed within its own set of parentheses, ensuring proper syntax.

3. **Use Proper Indentation and Formatting:** This enhances readability without affecting functionality but makes the code clearer.

The final corrected code correctly implements the intended logic with proper syntax for C-like language constructs.
