Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix this Python code based on the given error message. The user mentioned it's a syntax error, so something is wrong with the provided code snippet.

Looking at the code:
```python
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
First, I notice that there are four angle brackets: two before and after. In Python, using single quotes around strings is standard. Also, the structure seems off.

Breaking it down:
- The if statement starts with `if (x > 0)`.
- Then there's `《 a = 1; 》` which looks like an attempt to assign in a condition.
- After that, `else b = 2; 》` ends with a closing brace but seems misplaced.

In Python, each if statement should have its body indented. Also, the angle brackets are not valid syntax for assignments within conditions or as else clauses. Instead, I should replace those with parentheses to correctly structure the conditional expressions.

So, replacing 《 and 》 with ( and ), the code becomes:
```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
This way, each condition is properly enclosed in parentheses, assignments are within the if-else blocks, and indentation is correct. The semicolons after assignments should remain as they are valid in Python.

I think this should fix the syntax error by correcting the structure and replacing invalid characters with proper syntax.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error, we need to replace the angle brackets 《 and 》 with parentheses since they're not valid in a Python context. The corrected code properly structures the if-else statement using parentheses.

The fixed code is:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

This uses proper indentation for readability and replaces the invalid characters with standard syntax for conditional statements in Python.
