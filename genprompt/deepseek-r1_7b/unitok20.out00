Thinking...
Alright, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax issue and wants me to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond the given hints.

The code is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

First, I notice that the structure doesn't look like standard programming syntax. The 'if' statement usually has an opening and closing parenthesis for conditions, but here it's using Chinese characters which might be placeholders or part of some other system.

Looking at the code inside the if condition: `《 a = 1; 》`. This seems like it's trying to assign a value when x>0. The else clause is written as `else b = 2;` but it's closed with another 《, which might be causing issues.

I recall that in some languages or systems, Chinese characters are used for syntax elements. Maybe the 《 and 》 are acting like parentheses? So perhaps they should be replaced with regular parentheses ( ) to fix the structure.

Also, looking at the code flow: after the if-else block, there's another closing brace, which might not be needed or misplaced.

So I think replacing the Chinese characters with standard parentheses would help. Let me try that:

```
if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;
```

This way, the if statement correctly encloses the condition and its block. The else is placed properly after the if's closing parenthesis without needing another closing brace.

I should also check for any other possible syntax errors, but this seems to fix the main issue with the misplaced braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;
```
