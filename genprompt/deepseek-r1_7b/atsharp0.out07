Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. So, looking at the code provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, okay, I see that there's an if statement here. The condition is x > 0, which seems fine. Then inside the parentheses, they have "@ a = 1;" and outside with a comment "#", it says "else b = 2;".

Wait, in programming, after an if statement, you usually have an else block. But here, there's something before the condition that might be causing confusion. The line starts with @ a = 1; which doesn't make sense because in most languages like JavaScript or Python, assignments are done with '=' not '@'. 

So maybe the code is mixing up operators. Perhaps they meant to write an assignment inside the if block instead of using @. If I change @ to '=', then it would be correct.

Also, looking at the second line: # else b = 2; # The comments here don't seem necessary and might not be intended. Maybe those lines should be removed or restructured.

Putting it together, perhaps they wanted an if-else structure where inside the if block, a is assigned to 1, and in the else block, b is assigned to 2. So the code should look like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each condition has its corresponding assignment within braces, making it clear and syntactically correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
