Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing an error. Let me take a look at it. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, the error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So something's wrong with the closing brackets here.

I remember that in programming, when you have an if-else statement, each condition should be properly enclosed. In this case, it looks like there are Chinese punctuation marks being used instead of the correct ones.

Wait, the code uses 《 and 》 around a = 1; and then another 》 after else. That doesn't look right because in many languages like JavaScript or Python, we use parentheses for conditions but don't typically put special brackets unless necessary. 

Maybe this is using Chinese full-width characters instead of regular ones? So the code should probably be using normal parentheses.

Let me think about how to fix it. The original line has:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after the else clause, there's an extra 》 which is causing the error because it doesn't match the opening parenthesis properly.

I think the correct approach is to replace the 《 and 》 with regular parentheses ( and ). So the code should be rewritten as:

if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;

That way, each condition has its own parentheses, and after the else clause, there's no extra closing bracket left.

Let me check again. The if statement starts with (x>0), then inside it's a=1;. After that, for the else part, we have else followed by b=2; without any brackets around it because in JS, you can write expressions after else without parentheses when they're single statements.

So yes, replacing 《 with ( and 》 with ) should fix the syntax error. The code will now correctly close each block properly.
...done thinking.

The error occurs due to incorrect use of Chinese full-width brackets instead of regular ones. Replace them with standard parentheses.

```fix
if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;
```
