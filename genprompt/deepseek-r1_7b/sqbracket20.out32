Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code snippet provided by the user and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that there's an error message saying "syntax error," so something's definitely off here.

First, I see the if statement structure: `if (x > 0)`. That looks fine on its own. Then comes `[ a = 1; ]` which catches my attention because in many programming languages, square brackets are used for arrays or lists. But here, they're trying to assign a value inside them. That might not be correct.

Looking closer, the syntax seems off within the square brackets. It starts with `[ a = 1; ]`, but without any operator between the bracket and 'a'. Usually, in languages like C, you might write `a[] = 1;` for arrays, or use parentheses if it's an expression. So maybe the code is trying to do something else here.

Then there's the `else b = 2; ]` part. The closing square bracket after 'b=2' looks odd because in an if-else statement, you don't typically have a separate block for each condition unless using braces or specific syntax like in JavaScript with curly braces and semicolons inside.

Wait, maybe this code is written in JavaScript? Because in JavaScript, the if statement can be written with square brackets sometimes, especially when dealing with objects. But even then, writing `[a=1;]` doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using a different syntax altogether. The user mentioned that the syntax might differ from languages like C, Java, Python, etc., so maybe it's something else.

Looking at the code again: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. I notice that there are two closing brackets at the end. In JavaScript, you usually close with curly braces and semicolons inside, but here they're using square brackets which might not be valid.

I think the main issue is the use of square brackets around the assignment statements. They should probably be removed because in an if-else structure, each condition's block starts after the respective keyword (like if or else) without needing to enclose everything in brackets unless it's part of a specific feature, which I'm not sure about here.

So, I'll remove the square brackets around `a = 1` and `b = 2`. That should fix the syntax error because now each assignment is correctly placed under its respective condition.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to misplaced assignments within the if-else statement. The correct structure assigns values directly after `if` or `else`.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```
