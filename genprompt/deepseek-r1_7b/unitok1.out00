Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's wrong here. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a problem with closing brackets or parentheses somewhere.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I see an if statement. The structure should be `if (condition) { ... }` followed by an optional else clause. But here, instead of curly braces `{}`, there are these symbols: 《 and 》. Maybe they're trying to use some kind of angle bracket or maybe a typo.

The error message mentions '》' after the else clause. So perhaps the code is incorrectly closing something that's not supposed to be closed. Let me check how the if statement ends. The code starts with `if (x > 0) 《`, then inside, there's `a = 1;` and `》`. Then it goes into the else part: `else b = 2;` followed by another '》'.

Wait a minute, that last '》' is after the else statement. That doesn't make sense because in an if-else structure, each clause (if and else) should be enclosed within their own braces, right? So maybe the code intended to use curly braces but instead used angle brackets which don't exist here.

Alternatively, perhaps they're using a different syntax where 《 and 》 are being used as some kind of markers. But in standard Python or JavaScript, those aren't valid characters for block delimiters. Wait, looking at the code again, it's likely using another language because I see a semicolon after else, which is more common in languages like JavaScript.

Wait, maybe this isn't any programming language but pseudocode? Or perhaps it's a mix-up between different syntaxes. Hmm.

But regardless, the main issue is that there are extra closing brackets '》' at the end of both if and else clauses. So I need to remove those because they're causing the error. Let me see:

The corrected code should have curly braces for each block instead of 《 and 》. But wait, maybe in this context, the user wants to use these symbols as delimiters? Or perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, looking again: The if statement has (x>0) followed by 《a=1;》 which looks like they're trying to write an if block with braces but using angle brackets. But those angle brackets aren't valid in this context. So that part is wrong.

Similarly, the else clause ends with another '》', which is causing the error because it's closing something that shouldn't be closed after else.

So, I think the fix is to replace the 《 and 》 with curly braces { and } for both if and else blocks. That way, the code will properly structure the if-else statements without any syntax errors.

Let me write out the corrected code:

Change `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》` to `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`

And change `else b = 2; 》` to `else b = 2; }`

Wait, but the else doesn't need braces if it's just one line. So perhaps using {} is acceptable here.

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }

That should fix the syntax error because now the if and else clauses are properly enclosed with curly braces, and the extra '》' after else isn't needed anymore.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
