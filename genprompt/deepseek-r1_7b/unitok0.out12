Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's see what the original code looks like:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I know that using angle brackets like << or >> for code inside comments is not standard. The user mentioned using only the error message and without relying on pre-trained knowledge, so I should base this solely on the syntax issue.

The code has '《' and '》' which are probably meant to be used as comments but aren't valid syntax in Python. In Python, single-line comments start with #, so replacing those angle brackets with '#' makes sense.

Looking at the structure: if (x > 0) is followed by a =1; inside << >>, then else b=2;. Wait, that's not right because after the first comment, there's an extra 'else' and another line. So maybe the formatting was off.

I think the code should be written with proper indentation and using single-line comments correctly. So replacing 《 and 》 with # should fix it.

So the corrected code would look like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

This way, each condition has its corresponding code on the next line with proper indentation.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
