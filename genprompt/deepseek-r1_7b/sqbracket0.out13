Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error" and the code they wrote is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Okay, first, I'll look at the structure of the if statement. In most programming languages like C++ or Java, an if statement should have braces {} to enclose the block of code that's supposed to execute when the condition is true. Here, they're using square brackets [ ] instead.

Looking closer, after the if condition, there's a closing bracket and then another one outside the else clause. Wait, no, actually, it's more like this: inside the if block, they have [ a = 1; ], which includes a semicolon at the end of that line. Then, the else part is written as else b = 2; ] but with an extra closing bracket at the end.

So, I think the main issues here are:

1. The use of square brackets instead of braces to enclose code blocks in if statements.
2. The missing opening brace after the condition inside the if statement, which causes a syntax error because it's expecting something between the [ and ] for the block.
3. There's an extra closing bracket at the end that doesn't match any open brace, leading to a mismatched structure.

Let me break it down step by step:

First, in C++ or Java, each control statement like if must have braces {} around its body. So instead of using [ and ], which might be used for array literals or other structures, we should use { and } here.

So the original code is: 

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Breaking it down:

- The if condition is correct.
- Then they have [ a = 1; ], which is like an array or something, but in this context, it's not needed. They probably meant to have the block of code inside braces.

But wait, no, actually, in C++, after the parenthesis for conditions, you don't need brackets unless you're using them for some specific structure like a lambda expression. So they should be using { } instead of [ ] here.

So changing those would fix that part. Then, looking at the else part: else b = 2; ] But wait, in C++, after an if statement, whether it's simple or compound (with braces), you can have else on the same line with no block unless it's a multi-line condition with {}.

Wait, but actually, for an if without braces, like:

if (x > 0) b = 2;

That's acceptable in C++, though not preferred. But in this case, they have [ a=1; ] else..., which suggests that the initial code might have been trying to write a compound if with multiple branches.

But regardless, let's focus on fixing the syntax based on the error message and the provided code.

So, replacing the square brackets with braces around the if block:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in this case, the else statement is followed by a semicolon. Let me check: In C++, after an else clause, you can have code without braces as well, like:

if (condition) do_something();
else do_other_thing();

But that's for compound statements where each side has only one statement.

In this case, the original code is trying to assign a=1 inside if and b=2 in else. So perhaps they meant it to be an if-else with multiple statements on each branch.

Wait, but looking at their code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So the first part after if is [ a =1; ], which might have been intended as a block. Then else... But in reality, they're using square brackets instead of braces.

So to fix this, I'll replace those with braces:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But wait, the original code ends with ] else..., and then another ]; So maybe it's better to structure it properly.

Wait, perhaps they intended something like:

if (x>0)
    [a=1;
]
else
    b=2;

Which is not correct because in C++, you can't have statements inside square brackets. But that might be why they used the square brackets—it was a mistake.

So to fix this, I'll change them to braces and properly indent if necessary.

Putting it all together:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That should resolve the syntax error because now the code inside the if is enclosed in braces, which is correct. The extra closing bracket at the end was causing another issue, so removing that as well.

Wait, but looking back, the user's code had:

if (x >0) [ a=1; ] else b =2; ]

So after fixing with { }, it would be:

if (x>0){a=1;}else b=2;

Which is concise and correct. Alternatively, keeping the same formatting but using braces.

So I think that's the correct fix.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax errors due to incorrect use of square brackets instead of braces for enclosing code blocks in control structures like if-else statements. Here's the fixed version:

```c++
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This change replaces the square brackets with proper braces `{}` around the block of code following `if`, and removes the extra closing bracket, ensuring that each control structure is correctly enclosed.
