Thinking...
Alright, so I've got this code snippet that's causing a syntax error. Let me try to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. The user mentioned they're using an error message from an else clause where an unexpected '>' is found. So looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I see that there are some symbols here: 《 and 》 which look like Unicode characters for left and right single angle brackets. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, meaning maybe something is wrong with how these brackets are being used.

Wait, in the code, after the if statement, they have 《 a = 1; 》. That seems like it might be trying to enclose some code inside angle brackets, perhaps for emphasis or formatting. But then, there's an else followed by b = 2; and another '》' at the end.

So maybe the structure is incorrect because the if statement isn't properly closed before the else. Let me think about how conditional statements are structured in most programming languages. It's usually like:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

Or sometimes without braces, just using colons and keywords.

In this code, the initial part is `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》`. That seems to enclose 'a=1' within angle brackets. Then after that, it's followed by an else clause: `else b = 2;` but then there's another '》' at the end.

Wait, so maybe the problem is that the code has two closing brackets where they shouldn't be. Let me check:

- The first part opens with if and closes with 》.
- Then comes else which starts after the condition ends.
- But wait, in this case, the if's block isn't properly closed because there's an else attached right after it without braces.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle brackets are being used incorrectly. Maybe they're not necessary or misplaced.

Wait, looking at the code again: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`

So the structure is:

- if condition then ... closing with '》'
- else clause starting immediately after without braces
- Then another '》' at the end.

That would cause a syntax error because the code inside the if isn't properly closed, and the else might be attached incorrectly.

Wait, but in many languages, you can have an else right after the if's closing parenthesis as long as it's on the same line. So maybe that part is okay, but perhaps the angle brackets are causing issues.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the code has two closing braces: one for the if and another unexpected one at the end.

Wait, in the original code, after else b=2; there's another 》 which might not be needed. So perhaps the extra '》' is causing the error because it closes something prematurely.

So to fix this, I should check where those brackets are used.

Looking again:

The if statement starts with `if (x > 0)`, then uses 《 and 》 around a=1; which might not be necessary. Then after that, else b=2; is written right away, but perhaps the code needs to enclose more than just the condition in braces.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the if's block isn't properly closed because it's followed by an else without any braces. So perhaps adding braces around the if and else blocks would help.

But wait, looking at the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, so after the else clause, there's a 》 which is unexpected. That suggests that maybe the code has an extra closing bracket where it shouldn't.

So perhaps the structure should be:

if (x>0) { ... } else { ... }

But in this case, without braces, but the user might have used angle brackets for some reason.

Alternatively, maybe the code intended to use parentheses around multiple conditions or expressions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: count the number of opening and closing brackets. The code has 《 at position after if (x>0), then 》 after a=1; then else b=2; and another 》. So two '》' in total.

But maybe the correct structure should only have one '》' after the if, and an 'else' without any additional brackets unless necessary.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to use angle brackets around the assignment a=1 but that's unnecessary because it's inside the if block. But then the else comes right after the closing 》 of the if condition.

So maybe the problem is that the else is attached directly to the if without any braces or proper structure.

Wait, in many languages, you can have:

if (condition) statement1
else     statement2

But not sure about using angle brackets here. Alternatively, perhaps the code should use braces for clarity and correctness.

So maybe adding braces around both the if and else blocks would fix it. But looking at the error message again: unexpected '》' after else clause, which suggests that the else is attached to a block that's already been closed.

Alternatively, perhaps the extra 》 at the end is causing an issue because there are more closing brackets than needed.

So let me try to rewrite the code:

Original:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I think the main issues are:
1. The angle brackets after if and else might not be necessary or could be misplaced.
2. The extra '》' at the end is causing an unexpected closing.

So perhaps I should remove the unnecessary angle brackets around a=1, use braces for the if-else blocks to avoid confusion, and ensure that each block has exactly one opening and closing bracket.

Let me try:

if (x > 0) {a = 1;}
else {
    b = 2;
}

But in this case, I'm using braces which are more conventional. However, since the user's code uses angle brackets for some reason, maybe they prefer those or it's part of a specific syntax.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial code is trying to write something like:

if (x > 0) [a =1]
else    [b=2]

But with angle brackets. So instead of braces, using angle brackets around each statement.

So maybe changing that would fix it.

Alternatively, since the error message mentions an unexpected '》' after else clause, perhaps there's a missing opening bracket before else or something is misplaced.

Wait, looking again:

The code is:

if (x>0)《a=1;》 else b=2; 》

So between if and else, it's written as ... 》 else..., which might not be valid because the if block ends with '》', so after that, there should be an else clause without another condition.

Wait no, in reality, after the if statement's closing parenthesis, you can have an else attached directly. So perhaps the structure is:

if (x>0) [code] else [else code]

But here, the problem might be that the code inside the if isn't properly enclosed or there are extra brackets.

Alternatively, maybe the extra 》 at the end is causing a syntax error because it's not needed.

So to fix this, perhaps I should remove the extra 》 after the else line and enclose everything correctly.

Let me attempt:

if (x >0) {a=1;}
else {b=2;}

But again, using braces. However, if the user prefers angle brackets, then it would be:

if (x>0) 《a=1;》
else 《b=2;》

Wait, but that might not fix the issue because in this case, each condition has its own block.

Alternatively, maybe just remove all unnecessary angle brackets and use braces for clarity.

But given the error message is about an unexpected '》' after else clause, perhaps it's better to enclose both if and else blocks within their own { } correctly.

So putting it together:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
}
else {
    b=2;
}

This way, each block is properly enclosed with braces, which might fix the syntax error. Alternatively, using angle brackets as per original code but ensuring proper nesting.

Alternatively, perhaps in this specific context, using braces isn't allowed or necessary, so removing them and fixing the structure would be better.

So I think adding braces around both if and else blocks will resolve the issue because it ensures each block is properly closed without any unexpected closing brackets.
...done thinking.

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else {
    b=2;
}

The fixed code removes unnecessary angle brackets and uses braces to properly close the if-else structure.
