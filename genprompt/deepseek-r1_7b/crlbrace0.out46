Thinking...
Alright, I'm faced with fixing a syntax error in a small piece of code. The user provided an error message and some code that's not working. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

Looking at the error message: it says "syntax error." That means somewhere in the code, something is wrong with how the statements are structured or the syntax isn't valid for the programming language (I assume it's JavaScript based on common practices).

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Hmm, let me parse this line by line. The if statement checks if x is greater than 0. If true, it assigns 1 to 'a' inside the curly braces. Then there's an else clause written as `else b = 2;` but it ends with a semicolon and then another closing brace.

Wait, in JavaScript, each statement must end with a semicolon. So looking at the code structure:
- The if block is correct: `{ a = 1; }`
- Then comes the else clause: `else b = 2;` But wait, this should be part of an if statement, so it needs to be inside curly braces as well.

So the original code has two issues. First, after the else statement, there's another semicolon before the closing brace, which is incorrect because the else block isn't properly enclosed. Second, maybe the 'else' is not followed by a condition correctly or perhaps missing an opening brace.

Wait no, looking again: The if statement starts with `{`, then inside it assigns to a, and closes with `}`. Then outside, there's an else clause that just says `b = 2;` but without being within any block. That can't be right because in JavaScript, the else must be part of an if condition.

Wait no, perhaps the code was intended to have an else with its own block. So maybe it should look like this: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Yes, that makes sense. The original code didn't have braces around the else statement's assignment. Also, I notice there are two semicolons at the end of the if block and the else line might not be properly connected.

Wait, in the provided code, after the else b=2; there's another semicolon before the closing brace `}`? Let me count: 

The original code ends with:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
So it's missing an opening brace for the else part. So to fix this, I need to add an opening curly brace after 'else' and close it before the final semicolon.

Also, looking at line breaks: in JavaScript, you can't have statements without proper braces unless using ES6 features like block groups with semicolons, but that's more complex. But assuming we're dealing with a basic fix here.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```
That way, each condition has its own block enclosed within curly braces. This will resolve any syntax issues because now both the if and else parts are properly structured with their respective braces.
...done thinking.

The original code had two main issues: it was missing an opening brace after `else`, and there were extra semicolons causing incorrect block structures.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
