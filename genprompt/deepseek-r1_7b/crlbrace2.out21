Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code snippet here, and there's a syntax error. The user wants me to fix it without looking up anything beforehand. Let me take a look.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

And the error message says: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds familiar. I remember that in programming, braces must be properly opened and closed. Let me break it down.

Looking at the code structure. The if statement starts with an opening brace `{`, then inside, there's a semicolon `a = 1;`. Then comes an else clause without any block, just `else b = 2;`. After that, another closing brace `}` is added.

Wait, but in most languages like JavaScript or Java, the else clause must be followed by a block enclosed in braces. If there's no code inside the else, you still need to have an opening brace `{` after else and before the semicolon. Otherwise, it's considered a syntax error because the parser expects another statement within the else block.

So in this case, the code is missing an opening brace for the else part. The current structure has `else b = 2; }`, which means the closing brace at the end doesn't match any open brace except the outer one of the if statement. But since the else was written without a block, that's where the issue arises.

To fix this, I should add an opening brace `{` right after `else`. That way, both the if and else clauses have their own blocks enclosed properly. So the corrected code would look like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Let me check again: the outer if has `{ ... }`, then inside it's just `a=1;`. Then the else is followed by `{` to start its block, and `b=2;` inside. Finally, one closing brace for each block.

Yes, that should fix the error because now all braces are properly matched.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
