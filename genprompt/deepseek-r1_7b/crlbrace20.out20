Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code snippet here with a syntax error. Let me try to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, looking at the structure, there's an if-else statement. In most programming languages, each condition in an if-else block should be followed by a block of code indented properly. So I think that might be part of the issue.

Wait, let me check. The if statement has { a = 1; }, which seems fine inside its braces. Then there's an else without any opening brace, but wait—the else is followed by b=2;, right? But in languages like Java or C++, each condition (if and else) must be followed by a block enclosed in curly braces.

So the problem here might be that after the else statement, it's not starting a new block. The line "else b = 2;" doesn't have an opening brace, which is causing a syntax error because the code inside the if-else isn't properly structured.

Another thing I notice is that in some languages like C or Java, you don't need semicolons after if and else conditions—it's just the condition without a semicolon. But here, the issue seems to be more about the structure of the blocks.

So to fix this, I should add an opening brace right after the else statement so that "b = 2;" is inside its own block. That way, each case (if and else) has its own block, which should resolve the syntax error.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would have both if and else statements enclosed in their respective braces. So the fixed version should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each statement inside the if and else blocks is properly enclosed, which should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
