Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code and the error message. The error is "syntax error," which means something is wrong with how the code is structured or written.

The code provided is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I notice that there are these characters: 《 and 》. They look like they might be angle brackets or some kind of quotation marks. In programming, when you want to include something in code within another code block, you usually use parentheses or brackets. But here, they're being used inside the if statement.

Let me think about how an if statement is typically structured. Usually, it's:
if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

So in this case, the condition is `(x > 0)`, which seems correct. Then there's some code block after `《 a = 1; 》`. The syntax here might be wrong because 《 and 》 aren't recognized as valid syntax for defining blocks.

Wait, maybe these are supposed to be curly braces {} but they're written differently. In some languages or contexts, people use 《 and 》 as alternative notations for curly braces. But in standard programming, especially in if statements, the correct block starts with { and ends with }.

So perhaps replacing those angle brackets with curly braces would fix the syntax error. Let me try that. If I change `《 a = 1; 》` to `{ a = 1; }`, does that make sense?

Now, looking at the entire code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Does this look correct? Let me check. The if statement checks if x is greater than 0, and if so, assigns a to 1. If not, it assigns b to 2. That makes sense logically.

I think that's the main issue here: using angle brackets instead of curly braces for the code blocks inside the if statement. So replacing them should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code uses incorrect characters (《 and 》) to denote code blocks within an `if` statement, which is not valid syntax in programming languages. The correct approach is to use standard curly braces `{}`.

Here's the fixed version of the code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
