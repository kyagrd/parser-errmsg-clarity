Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me take a look at it. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, right off the bat I notice something wrong with how the if statement is structured. In JavaScript or other similar languages, when you have an if statement, inside the parentheses after the condition, you typically don't use square brackets like that. Instead, it's usually just a comma-separated list of statements.

Wait, looking closer, the code has `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Oh, I see now! The problem is with how the if-else block is closed. Normally, after an if statement that uses braces for the body, you just close it once at the end of the opening brace.

So in this case, the code starts with `if (x > 0) [`, which isn't correct because square brackets are typically used for arrays or objects, not for defining code blocks. Instead, they should use curly braces `{}`. But even more importantly, after an if statement that has a body, you don't need to have another else block unless it's part of the same structure.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think again. The original code is trying to write:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But this would be incorrect because square brackets aren't used for if-else blocks in JavaScript. Instead, each block uses curly braces `{}`.

So the error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That makes me think that there's an extra closing bracket somewhere. Let me count the brackets here.

Looking at the code:

`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

I can see two closing braces: one after `a=1;` and another at the end of the line with `else...`. But in JavaScript, an if statement doesn't require those extra brackets. So perhaps the code was trying to write something like:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But due to incorrect syntax, it's using square brackets instead.

So the mistake is that the user used `[` and `]` where curly braces `{}` should be. Also, there's an extra closing bracket at the end which isn't needed because the if-else block doesn't require another set of braces after else unless they're part of a compound condition (like using && or ||).

So to fix it, I need to replace all square brackets with curly braces and remove the last one.

Let me rewrite that:

Original code:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Fixed version should be:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in JavaScript, you don't need the braces for single-line statements. So actually, even `{}` is optional if it's just one line. But using them doesn't cause any issues.

So to strictly follow the syntax, perhaps replacing [ with { and ] with }, and removing the last ] would fix both the error of using square brackets instead of curly braces and also eliminate the extra closing bracket which was causing the parse error.
...done thinking.

The code incorrectly uses square brackets `[]` for an if-else block, which should use curly braces `{}`. Additionally, there's an unnecessary closing bracket at the end.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
