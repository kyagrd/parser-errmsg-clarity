Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause in an if statement which is already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I notice that the code ends with two closing braces: one after the if block and another at the end of the line. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So there's an opening brace for the if condition, then inside it's a semicolon, then after closing that brace with }, and then another else clause followed by another semicolon. But wait, the else is part of the same if statement because it doesn't have its own braces yet.

Wait, no. The code as written has:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2; }

So let me parse this step by step.

The first line is correct: if condition with a block. Then after that, there's an else statement without any braces. So the else should be part of the same if. But in code structure, each else must correspond to an if. If they're not enclosed in braces, it might depend on the language whether it's allowed or not.

But regardless, looking at the error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So that suggests that there's a closing brace where it shouldn't be.

Looking back at the code:

After the if block is }, then the next line is else b=2; and then another }. Wait, but in the given code, does it have an extra }?

Wait, perhaps the original code has two closing braces: one after the if statement's body and another at the end of the else clause. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as:

if (x>0) { a=1; }

else b=2;

}

Which would mean that after the first }, then there's an else without braces, followed by another } which isn't needed.

Wait, but in reality, each if-else pair can be on separate lines with or without braces. So perhaps the code is structured as:

if (x>0) { a=1; }

else b=2;

}

But that would mean after the else clause, there's an extra } which isn't part of any block.

Alternatively, maybe the code should have braces for each statement inside if and else to avoid ambiguity. So perhaps the correct way is:

if (x>0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, it's written as two lines without braces around the else part.

So looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Wait, that might be the issue. The code after the if block closes with }, then writes else and assigns to b=2;, but perhaps it's not properly enclosed in braces.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
}else
b=2;

Which would have the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from having two closing braces. Because in the original code, after the if block closes with }, then there's an else statement which starts on the next line without any braces for that else clause. Then another } at the end of the line? Or maybe not. Let me see:

The code as written is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block's }, there's an else statement with b=2;, and then another }.

Wait, perhaps the original code has two closing braces: one for the if block, and then an extra one at the end. So in this case:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a=1; }

Line 2: } else b=2;

Line 3: }

So the line with else would have }, but that's not correct because the else should be part of the same if statement, which is already closed.

Wait, perhaps the code ends with two closing braces. So after else b=2;, there's another }, making it three } in total?

No, looking again: the original code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that would be four lines? Or perhaps the user wrote it with two closing braces at the end.

Wait, maybe the code has an extra } after else. Let me count the characters.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code is:

if (x > 0) { a=1; } else b=2;

}

Which would have the first if block closed with }, then else on next line without braces, and another } at the end. So that's three } in total: one after if, one after else, and one extra at the end.

Wait no, because each statement should be properly enclosed. Let me think again.

In code structure:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a=1; }

Line 2: } else b=2;

But that's incorrect syntax in most languages because the else is not within braces. So perhaps it's supposed to have braces for both, like:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

Which would require two opening and closing braces.

In the original code, there's only one brace after if, then another } which is causing an error because it doesn't match any open brace. So perhaps the solution is to add braces for each else clause.

So maybe the fixed code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

else {

    b = 2;

}

Alternatively, with minimal changes, but according to the error message, it's expecting only the use of symbols present in the error message. The error is about an unexpected '}' after else clause.

Wait, perhaps the code should have braces around each statement inside if and else.

So let me write the fixed code:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in that case, we're adding braces where they weren't present before. But according to the error message, I should use only symbols available from the error message, which includes }, but not sure about {.

Wait, no: The error says "unexpected '}' after else clause", so maybe it's because there are two closing braces in a row. So perhaps the code has an extra } after else without matching code.

So looking at the original code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Wait, that would have:

Line 1: if condition with block up to }

Line 2: else statement and b=2;

Line 3: another }

But in reality, this is causing the else clause to end abruptly. So perhaps it's missing a closing brace for the else.

Alternatively, maybe the code has an extra } at the end of the second line.

Wait, but in any case, I think adding braces around each block would fix the issue because then each if-else will have their own braces, which might resolve the syntax error.

So perhaps the correct way is to add { and } for each else clause.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace after the `else` statement. Adding curly braces to both the `if` and `else` blocks fixes this syntax error.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
