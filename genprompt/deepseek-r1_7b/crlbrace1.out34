Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, my goal is to understand why the error occurs and how to correct it without using any pre-trained knowledge.

First, let's examine the original code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I notice that there are two closing braces `}` in this code. The first one is after the if statement: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`, which properly closes with one brace. Then, the else clause is written as `else b = 2; }`—this part has another closing brace.

The error message mentions that there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. This suggests that there are too many braces in the code. In programming languages like JavaScript or Python, each control structure should have a matching opening and closing brace. 

Looking at the code again, the if statement is enclosed within one set of braces `{}`, which is correct. However, the else part doesn't enclose its block properly. The else keyword comes after the if condition without an opening brace, so it's just `else b = 2; }`. This means that the else clause isn't wrapped in braces, causing a syntax error because there's an extra closing brace at the end of the code.

To fix this, I should add another set of braces to enclose both the if and else blocks. So, wrapping the else block in its own braces will ensure that each statement is properly enclosed and the syntax errors are resolved.

Let me rewrite the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Here, I added an opening brace `{` after `else` to start the else block and another closing brace `}` at the end of it. Now, each condition has its own braces, so there's no extra closing brace left at the end. This should eliminate the syntax error mentioned in the error message.

I also need to make sure that I'm following the instructions correctly: using only the provided error message and not relying on any pre-trained knowledge. By analyzing the error message about an unexpected '}', I deduced that there were extra braces, which led me to add a missing pair of braces around the else statement.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
