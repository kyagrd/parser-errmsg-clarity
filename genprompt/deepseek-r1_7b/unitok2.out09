Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The code is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

And the error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause because the if statement already closed. Hmm, so I guess it's about closing brackets correctly.

Looking at the code, I see that the if block starts with (x >0) and then has a 《 before a=1; and a 》 right after. Then there's an else followed by b=2; and another 》. Wait, but in normal syntax, each if-else statement should have its opening and closing brackets matched.

In the original code, it's like:
if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But here, the user used 《 and 》 instead of regular parentheses or maybe other symbols? Or perhaps they're using them as block boundaries. Maybe in their language, these symbols are part of the syntax for blocks.

Wait, but looking at the error message: it's an unexpected '》' after else clause because the if statement already closed. So that means there's a mismatch in the brackets.

In the code, after the else, they have b=2; followed by another 》. But before the else, they had a 《 and a 》 around a=1;. So perhaps the code is using some kind of block syntax where each if-else needs to be enclosed with their own braces or brackets.

So maybe the original structure is incorrect because after the else clause, there's an extra closing bracket. Let me count:

The code starts with:
if (x>0)《a=1;》 else b=2;》

Breaking it down:
- if condition: x>0
  - then a=1;
    - closed with 》
- else
  - b=2;
    - closed with another 》, which is unexpected because the outer if statement has already been closed.

So the error is that there's an extra closing bracket after the else clause. The code should only have one closing bracket at the end of the entire if block.

Therefore, I think the solution is to remove the last 》 so that it's:
if (x >0)《a=1;》else b=2;

Wait, but wait: in the original code, after else b=2;, there's a semicolon and then another 》. So removing the last 》 would fix the syntax because now the if statement is properly closed.

So I'll adjust that part.
...done thinking.

The error arises because an extra closing bracket `》` appears after the `else`, which closes the outermost block prematurely. Removing the redundant closing bracket fixes this.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
