Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of JavaScript or similar code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a misplaced brace somewhere.

The original code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, let me break this down. The structure here is an if-else statement. Normally, it should look like this: 

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

In the given code, after the if block closes with }, there's an else clause written as "else b = 2;". But wait, in JavaScript, the else must be followed by a block enclosed in curly braces. So it should be:

else { b = 2; }

But looking at the original code, after the first } (which closes the if statement), there's an else without any opening brace. Then "b=2;" is outside both blocks because there's no matching closing brace.

So the mistake here is that the else clause doesn't have its own block. The code as written would cause a syntax error because it has an extra } after the else, which isn't matched.

To fix this, I need to add curly braces around the else part so that it correctly forms another statement block. Let me rewrite the code accordingly.

So the corrected version should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, both the if and else clauses have their own blocks properly enclosed with braces.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because the `else` clause is not properly closed. We need to add `{}` for the `else` statement.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
