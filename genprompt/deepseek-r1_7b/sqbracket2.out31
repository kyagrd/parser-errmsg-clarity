Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, it starts with an if statement. The condition is (x > 0), then inside the parentheses, but wait, in some languages like C or JavaScript, you don't put spaces there. Here, it's written as () without any space after the parenthesis. That might be okay.

Then, inside the if block, they have [ a = 1; ]. Wait, that doesn't look right. In many programming languages, square brackets are used for arrays or objects, but here they're using them around an assignment statement. Maybe this is incorrect syntax in whatever language this code is intended for.

After the if block, there's an else clause with b = 2; and then a ] which closes the if structure? But wait, looking at the error message, it says there's an unexpected ']' after else. So maybe the code has more brackets than needed.

Let me break down the code:

- The outermost is an if statement: if (x > 0) [ ... ] else b = 2; ]

Wait, that can't be right. The else is outside of the square brackets because it's part of the if condition, not the block. So maybe the structure is wrong.

I think the code should have the if and else clauses without the extra brackets around the statements. Let me try to restructure it.

Original code has:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So, inside the if condition's parentheses, they have square brackets which are probably causing issues. Also, after the if block, there's an else without any opening bracket or anything before it except the semicolon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But in this case, maybe the square brackets are unnecessary. So I'll remove the square brackets around a=1 and also fix the closing of the if statement's block.

So, removing [ ] from inside the if condition:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Wait, but that would make it two separate statements without proper braces. Hmm, maybe using {} is better for clarity and to avoid syntax errors.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses an older syntax where single-line statements don't need curly braces. But in any case, I think the main issue is the extra brackets causing a syntax error.

So, putting it all together, the corrected code should remove the unnecessary square brackets around a=1; and properly close the if statement's block with a ] or use braces.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because of an extra closing bracket `]` after the else clause. By removing this extra bracket, the syntax becomes correct.

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The original code has `[ a = 1; ]` inside an if condition's parentheses and an extra closing `]` after else.
2. These square brackets are unnecessary for single-line statements within the if condition.
3. Removing them allows proper syntax, leaving only one statement per conditional branch.

Corrected Code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
