Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. Let me take a look at it. The code is written within triple backticks, which probably means it's part of a programming snippet. The specific line in question is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I know that in many programming languages like C or Java, an if statement doesn't use square brackets for code blocks. Instead, they typically use braces `{}` because they are block-structured. So using square brackets here is incorrect.

Looking at the line: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

The part inside the square brackets seems to be trying to write an expression, but since it's within an if condition, maybe it was intended to be a single statement. So instead of using square brackets, which aren't valid syntax here, I should replace them with braces.

Also, in this structure, after the if block, there's an else clause that's part of the same if-else construct. But since the code inside is written within the square brackets, it might be causing a syntax error because the else isn't properly aligned or connected to the if statement.

So replacing [ with { and ] with } should fix this. Let me try rewriting the line:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That looks better. Now, each condition has its own block with braces. This way, when x is greater than 0, it assigns a=1, and otherwise, it assigns b=2 without any issues.

I should also check if there are any other syntax errors, but in this case, the main issue was using square brackets instead of braces. So that's probably the only fix needed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
