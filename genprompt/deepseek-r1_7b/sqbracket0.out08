Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And the user mentioned there's a syntax error and wants me to fix it without using pre-trained knowledge, just based on the error message.

First, I notice that the code has an if statement. The structure is if (condition), then some code inside, followed by else, and another piece of code. But looking at how it's written, there seems to be a problem with the brackets or semicolons.

In the original code, after the if condition, there are square brackets [ ]. I recall that in many programming languages like C++ or Java, these brackets must be matched properly. Here, the code inside the if is enclosed in [ ], but then there's an else statement without a matching opening bracket.

So, the first thing I should check is whether all brackets are correctly opened and closed. The code starts with [ after the if, which might not be necessary unless it's part of an array or something else, but since the user didn't mention that context, maybe those square brackets were added by mistake.

Looking at the structure again: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I think the square brackets around 'a=1' are causing an issue because there's no corresponding opening bracket before them. Also, after the else statement, there's another ] which probably doesn't belong.

So, my plan is to remove the unnecessary square brackets and ensure that each block of code is properly enclosed within its own set of brackets or by using appropriate syntax like braces for blocks without needing the square brackets.

Looking at how if-else statements are usually written in languages like JavaScript, they can be followed by a single statement or multiple statements enclosed in curly braces. Since the user's code has semicolons inside the if and else blocks, it seems like each block is just a single statement, so using parentheses isn't necessary here.

Therefore, I should rewrite the code to remove the square brackets after 'if' and before 'else', and instead use braces {} for both branches. This way, the syntax error will be fixed because all brackets are properly closed.

So, modifying the code step by step:

Original line: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Change to: if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}

Now, each condition has its own block with curly braces, which is the correct way in JavaScript for single-line statements. This should eliminate any syntax errors because all brackets are correctly matched and nested.

I think this fix addresses both the issue of missing brackets and unnecessary square brackets. Now, the code compiles without issues.
...done thinking.

The original code has a mismatched use of square brackets around the `if` condition. To fix the syntax error:

1. Remove the square brackets after `if`.
2. Use curly braces `{}` to properly enclose each statement block.

Here's the corrected code:
```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```
