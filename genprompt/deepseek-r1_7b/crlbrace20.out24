Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the error message is just "syntax error," which usually means something's wrong with the structure of the code. Let me look at the given code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces here. The if statement has `{ a = 1; }` and then outside of it, there's an `else` block with `b = 2;` but it also ends with a semicolon before another brace. So the code structure is probably incorrect.

Wait, in most programming languages like C or Java, the else clause should be inside the if statement's braces. Here, the way it's written might not parse correctly because there are two closing braces at the end. The first brace closes the if block, and then another one tries to close something else, but I'm not sure what.

Let me think about how this code would compile or run. The initial if statement is okay: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` sets 'a' to 1 if x is positive. Then there's an else part with `b = 2;`, but both are followed by semicolons and then another brace. This could be causing the syntax error because the code isn't properly structured.

So, I need to fix this so that the else clause is correctly placed inside the if statement without any extra braces. That means removing the second closing brace at the end of the code. Let me try rewriting it:

The corrected code should have only one opening brace after the if condition and only one closing brace at the very end. So, I'll adjust it to:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, there's no extra brace, which was causing the syntax error. Now, when this code runs in environments that support this kind of syntax, like certain custom scripts or specific languages where blocks can be declared without braces (though it's more common with), it should work correctly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
