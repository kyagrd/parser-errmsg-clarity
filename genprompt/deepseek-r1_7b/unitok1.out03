Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay. I see curly braces here instead of parentheses or brackets. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which is part of an if statement that's already closed. So probably, these curly braces are being used incorrectly.

In most programming languages like JavaScript or Python, we don't use curly braces for conditional statements; those are for blocks in things like objects or arrays. Instead, we use parentheses for conditions and then the words 'if' and 'else'. So maybe the person here tried to use curly braces but got it wrong.

Looking at the code again: after the if condition, there's 《 a=1; 》 which seems to be trying to enclose some code. But since this is an if statement without braces (like in JS), you just have the statements inside the parentheses. So perhaps they added extra curly braces incorrectly.

The code has 'if (x>0) 《 ... 》 else b=2; 》'—so there are two sets of curly braces: one after the if and another after the else. That's not right because the entire if-else block shouldn't have its own braces unless it's part of a larger structure like an object or array.

So, to fix this, I should remove those extra curly braces. The correct code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Or maybe even simpler without the braces if that's not needed for their language. But since they have braces in the original code, perhaps it's a different syntax.

Wait, but looking at the user's error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)"—so the parser thought there was an extra brace after else. So I should remove that trailing brace.

So putting it all together, removing both sets of curly braces except for what's necessary within if and else.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect use of curly braces `{}` with an `else` clause. We need to replace them with parentheses since the `if` statement doesn't require blocks in this context unless using a specific language feature.

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, that's not correct either—the braces after if and else are unnecessary for simple statements. The fixed code should be:

```fix
if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;
```
