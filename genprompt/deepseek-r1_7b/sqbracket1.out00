Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message says "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again. 

The code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Wait, I see brackets around the if condition. Oh right, in many languages like JavaScript or Python, you use parentheses for conditions. But here, it's using square brackets instead. That might be causing issues.

So the original code has (x > 0) inside square brackets, which is probably not what they intended. Maybe they meant to use parentheses and just have a statement inside without any braces. Or perhaps they were trying to structure it with some kind of array or list but messed up the syntax.

Looking at the error message again, it says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. So somewhere, the code is closing a bracket that shouldn't be closed. Let me count the brackets.

The first part: if (x > 0) [ ... ] That seems like a mistake because the condition should be in parentheses, not square brackets. Then inside those brackets, there's an assignment and a semicolon. After that, else b = 2; and then another closing bracket ]. So maybe the extra bracket at the end is causing the error.

So to fix this, I think they intended to have the if statement with conditions in parentheses, not square brackets. Also, removing the unnecessary array-like structure since there's no corresponding opening bracket before it. So simplifying that part might solve the problem.

If I remove the square brackets around (x > 0), then the code should be correct. Let me try rewriting it without the brackets and see if that fixes the issue.

So the corrected code would be:
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense because now there are no extra brackets causing the syntax error. Also, each statement after the if-else is properly indented without any missing brackets.
...done thinking.

The code has an incorrect use of square brackets for condition and an extra closing bracket. Removing unnecessary brackets fixes the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
