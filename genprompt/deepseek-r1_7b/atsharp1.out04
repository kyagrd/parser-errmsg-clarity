Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause because the if statement already closed. Hmm, let me look at the code.

The code is:
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I remember that in Ruby, you can write multi-line conditions using elsif and end clauses, but here it's trying to use an else with a '#' which isn't valid syntax. Oh right, in Ruby, you don't put a '#' after the else keyword because it's not necessary for the else block.

Wait, maybe the user was confused between another language where comments are used after statements. But in Ruby, we just end the line without any special characters unless using features like block_given? or next/prev.

So looking at the code, I see that after 'else b = 2;', there's a '#' which is causing an error because it's unexpected. So I should remove that '#'.

Also, checking if the parentheses are closed properly. The condition (x > 0) is fine, so no issues there.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;

I just removed the '#' after else because that's not valid in Ruby. That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
