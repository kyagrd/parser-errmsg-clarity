Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code they provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that in JavaScript, when you have control structures like if-else, each block should be properly closed with braces. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which suggests that a bracket is closing where it shouldn't or too early.

Looking at the code: 

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that inside the if statement, they have (x > 0) followed by [ a = 1; ]. That doesn't look right. Normally, you don't use square brackets for code blocks in JavaScript; braces are used. So maybe this is a typo or misunderstanding.

So, probably, they intended to write:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, they have [ and ] around 'a = 1;' which isn't valid syntax. Instead of square brackets, braces should be used for block statements.

Let me analyze where the error is happening. The if statement starts with (x > 0) followed by [. Then inside the else clause after ], there's an extra ]. Wait, no, in the code it's ] then another ; and then a ] again without matching {.

Wait, let me parse this correctly:

The original code:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Breaking it down:
- 'if (x > 0)' is correct.
- Then there's a [ after that. But in JavaScript, you can't have [ here unless maybe using template literals or something, but in this context, inside an if statement, that doesn't make sense.

So probably the intention was to use braces { and } instead of square brackets. So the code should be rewritten with correct block syntax.

Also, after the else clause, there's another ], which is not properly closed. The original code ends with ] after the else statement, so it's missing a corresponding {. 

Putting it all together, I think the corrected code should replace [ and ] with { and }, remove any trailing semicolons that are outside of blocks, and ensure each block has its own braces.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each statement inside the if-else is properly enclosed within braces, preventing any syntax errors. Also, I removed the semicolon after else because in JavaScript, you don't need to add it; it's part of the statement.

Let me check again: The original code had [ a = 1; ] which should be { }, and then the else was followed by an extra ], so adding another { for the else block would fix that. Also, trimming any trailing semicolons outside blocks as they're unnecessary.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because square brackets are used instead of braces `{}` in JavaScript control structures. The code incorrectly uses `[]` around `a = 1;`, and an extra `]` is present after the else clause without a matching brace.

Fixed Code:
```javascript
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The fixed code replaces the square brackets with braces `{}` for proper block syntax, ensuring each statement inside `if-else` is correctly enclosed.
