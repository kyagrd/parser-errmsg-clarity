Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause in an if statement that's already closed. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, I can see that it's using curly braces for the if statement. The if block has `a=1;` inside, which is fine. Then there's an else clause with `b=2;`. Wait, but after the else, there's another closing brace and then a semicolon. That seems off.

So breaking it down: the if statement starts with `{`, then the code inside, then `}`. The else should be part of that same if block. But in the current code, after the else, there's another `}`, which would close the if block again. But since the if only had one closing brace, having two braces would cause an error because the second `}` doesn't have a matching statement.

Let me visualize this. The correct structure should be:
```
if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
   // other code
}
```

But in the given code, after the else, it's just closing the if block again with another `}`, which is incorrect because there's no corresponding opening brace for that second `}`. So I need to remove the extra `}` at the end.

Wait, actually, looking again, the code has:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So after the else statement, there's an extra closing brace and then another semicolon. The second `}` is not needed because the if-else structure doesn't require it. So removing that last `}` should fix the syntax error.

Let me check again: without the last }, does the code make sense? Yes. Because after the else clause, which ends with a semicolon and curly brace, we don't need another } for the outer block since the if-else is properly closed by the initial {.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
