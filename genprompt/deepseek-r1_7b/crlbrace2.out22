Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me see what's wrong here.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I remember that in most programming languages, if statements have an opening and closing brace. So the structure is usually like this: if (...) { ... } else ...

Looking at the code, after the else statement, there's another '}' which might be causing the issue. Wait, let me count the braces.

The first line has "if (x > 0) { a = 1; }" — that uses two braces, one opening and one closing correctly. Then the else is followed by "b = 2;" but there's an extra '}' at the end after that.

So it looks like the code ends with two closing braces: one from the if statement and another unexpected one. That's why the error says there's an unexpected '}' because the parser thinks the block has already been closed.

I think the correct structure should be to have only one closing brace for both the if and else parts, but in this case, it's structured with an else that doesn't use a compound statement correctly. So perhaps the code is trying to do something different where after the if-else, there's another action.

Wait, looking again, maybe the user intended to write:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

In that case, both branches have their own braces. So in the original code, after the else statement, it was adding an extra '}' which wasn't needed.

So the fix would be to remove the trailing '}' at the end of the code. Let me check: without that last '}', does the structure make sense? Yes, because the if-else ends with one brace closing both blocks.

So the corrected code should have only one closing brace after else.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
