Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. So, looking at the code provided:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see that there are some unexpected characters here—specifically the symbols 《 and 》 which look like they're meant to be quotes but aren't standard. In Python, we use single or double quotes for defining code blocks, so these should probably just be regular parentheses.

Also, looking at the structure, it seems like there's an extra closing brace at the end. The original code has two closing braces: one after a = 1; and another at the end which doesn't make sense because there's only one condition (x >0) with else attached to it.

So breaking it down:

1. The line starts with if (x>0), but then immediately uses 《, which isn't valid syntax in Python.
2. Inside the if block, a =1; is correct except for the surrounding quotes.
3. Then there's an else clause: b=2;, followed by another closing brace, making it look like two separate blocks instead of one.

So to fix this:

- Replace 《 with ( and 》 with ) since they're likely meant to be parentheses.
- Remove the extra closing brace at the end because that's causing a syntax error.
- Ensure that each condition has its own block properly nested if needed, but here it's straightforward so just adjusting the braces should suffice.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should remove the 《 and 》, replace them with parentheses, and eliminate the extra closing brace at the end. That way, the syntax error is fixed, and the code runs correctly.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to incorrect use of quotes and an extra closing brace.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace `《` with `(`
2. Replace `》` with `)`
3. Remove the trailing extra closing brace
4. Ensure proper indentation for readability

Fixed code:
```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

The fixed code is:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
