Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, first thing I notice is that there are two closing braces. The if statement has one, but then the else block also ends with a brace, which might be causing issues because it's outside the if's block. Let me think about how conditional statements work in programming.

An if-else structure should have each block enclosed within their own braces. So the correct structure is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

In the given code, after the if statement's closing brace, there's an else followed by another brace and then b=2;. This would make the else part its own block because of the extra brace. But wait, in this case, the code only has one statement inside each block, so maybe it's not a problem, but I'm still confused about why there are two closing braces.

Wait, looking again: The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block, which ends with }, there's an else statement followed by another }. That means the else is its own block. But in reality, the else should be part of the if block, so it shouldn't have its own braces unless it has multiple statements.

But looking at the code, inside each brace, only one statement exists. So maybe that's acceptable. However, the real issue might be more about the syntax because I see two closing braces in a row after else b=2; which is causing an error.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that there are two } at the end, making it look like the code ends with a brace and then another line starts without any corresponding opening. Or maybe the second brace is misplaced.

But looking back, I think the main issue is that after the else statement, which should be part of the if block, but because of the extra }, it's causing a syntax error because there's an unmatched brace at the end.

Wait, no, let me count the braces. The code has { } for the if, then another } after else b=2; So that would mean two closing braces in a row: one from the if and another as the end of the else block. But actually, the else should be part of the if's block, so it shouldn't have its own brace unless it has multiple statements.

Wait, perhaps the code is intended to have only one statement per branch, which is acceptable, but the real issue is that after the else b=2; there are two closing braces, making the last line invalid because it ends with a brace and then an extra semicolon or something. Or maybe it's just a matter of having an extra }, causing a syntax error.

So to fix this, I think we should remove one of the braces so that each block is correctly enclosed within its own braces only if needed. Since both branches have single statements, perhaps using } for else isn't necessary unless there are multiple lines or statements in the else clause.

Alternatively, since the original code might have an extra }, leading to two closing braces at the end. So maybe removing one of them would fix it.

Wait, let me parse this step by step:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

This is parsed as:
- if statement with opening {, then a=1;, closing }
- then else b=2; and another }, which would be the end of whatever was opened last. So after else, it's looking for a block, but maybe that's incorrect.

But in reality, the else should belong to the nearest open brace, which is the if statement. So perhaps the code as written has two closing braces because else b=2; starts another block with }, making three lines at the end: } else b=2; }

Wait, actually, no. Let me write it correctly:

The correct structure would be:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, only one brace is after else, so it's not a block but just ends there.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count all the braces:

The if has one opening and one closing.
Then, after the closing }, we have 'else b = 2; }'

So that's another } at the end, making it three } in a row: two from else block? No.

Wait, perhaps the code is as follows:
- line 1: if (x >0) { ... ;
- line 3: } else b=2;
- line4: } 

Which would cause syntax errors because after the else statement, there's an extra }, which doesn't have a matching opening brace.

So to fix it, we should remove that last }, so that the code is:

if (x >0) { a =1; } else b=2;

That way, each block has one }, and the code ends correctly without any syntax errors.
...done thinking.

The original code had an extra closing curly brace after the `else` statement. By removing this extra brace, the syntax error is resolved.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
