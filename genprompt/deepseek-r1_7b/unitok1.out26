Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

The user provided the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
And the error message is: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)".

Hmm, okay. So I know that in programming, especially in languages like Python or JavaScript, braces {} are used for blocks of code. But here, they're using these symbols 《 and 》 which don't look like standard braces. Maybe the user was trying to use custom syntax markers but made a mistake.

Looking at the code structure: there's an if statement that checks if x > 0. Inside, it assigns a=1. Then, outside the block, they have '》 else b=2; 》'. Wait, so after the if condition, which is properly closed with }, they placed another 》 right before else. That's probably where the error comes in.

In most languages, when you have an if statement, it's followed by a block of code enclosed within { and }, then the else clause would be outside that block but usually part of a larger structure like using elif or just having separate blocks with proper indentation.

But here, the way they've written it is:
if (x > 0) 《 a =1; 》 else b=2; 》

So after the if's closing }, they have another brace-like symbol which doesn't match. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, meaning that when trying to process the else statement, it encountered something it didn't expect—a closing brace where it wasn't expecting one.

Wait, but in Python or JavaScript, you don't use 《 and 》; those are HTML entities for left and right angle brackets. So maybe they were supposed to write { and }, but used these symbols instead by mistake.

So the code is trying to close the if block with } which closes it correctly. Then immediately after that, they have another 》 before else. But since the previous brace was a single }, this extra 》 doesn't match anything because in most languages, you only need one closing brace per statement unless nesting occurs.

Wait no, actually, each { must be closed by a corresponding }. So if I have an if block that's properly opened with { and closed with }, then having another } would cause an error. But here they used 《 instead of {, which is being incorrectly closed as well.

So the main problem is that after the if statement's closing brace (}), there's an extra 》 before else. So in terms of structure, it should be:

if (x>0) {
   a=1;
} else {
   b=2;
}

But in the given code, they have:
if (x >0)《a=1;》else b=2;》

So if I convert 《 to { and 》 to }, it would make sense. So replacing those symbols with actual braces should fix the syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use angle brackets for comments or something else, but that's not standard in programming syntax.

Another possibility is that they used single-line conditionals without braces. In Python, you can write:

if x>0: a=1
else: b=2

But here, the code uses 《 and 》 which are not valid, so replacing them with { and } should fix it.

So to correct the error, I'll replace all instances of 《 with { and 》 with }, as they're just incorrect syntax being used in place of braces.
...done thinking.

The original code incorrectly uses angle brackets (《 and 》) where standard braces ({ and }) are required. Replacing these symbols fixes the syntax.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
