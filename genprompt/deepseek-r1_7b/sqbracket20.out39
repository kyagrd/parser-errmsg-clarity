Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, first off, I notice that there's an if statement here with some conditions and assignments inside brackets. The structure seems off because typically you don't put assignments inside the if condition in languages like C or Java. Also, the code ends with a semicolon after the else clause.

Looking at the error message, it just says "syntax error." So I need to figure out where exactly the syntax is breaking.

Starting from the top: the if statement is written as if (x > 0) [. That's not right because in most languages, like C or Java, you have braces {} for blocks. So instead of brackets [ ], which might be used elsewhere but aren't matching here, I should probably use braces to properly encapsulate the condition and its body.

So replacing the square brackets with curly braces makes sense. Let me rewrite that part: if (x > 0) { ... }

Now, inside the if block, there's a semicolon after a = 1;. That doesn't make sense because in languages like C or Java, you don't put semicolons at the end of assignments; they're statements and should be followed by another statement on the same line. So I think that might not be necessary.

Wait, actually, in many cases, it's common to have a semicolon after an assignment for clarity, but it's technically redundant because each statement ends with a semicolon. So maybe removing one of them would fix any potential issues. Let me check: if the code is written as [a = 1;], that might be unnecessary.

But looking at the else part: else b = 2; ] — this also has an extra bracket at the end, which doesn't match the opening square brace earlier. That's definitely a problem because the closing brace should match the opening one. So I need to remove that extra ] and replace it with } or another matching brace.

Putting it all together: The code starts with if (x > 0) [ ... but that's incorrect. Changing the brackets to braces and adjusting the structure, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each block inside the if-else is properly enclosed with its own braces, which should fix the syntax error. The semicolons at the end of each statement are also correctly placed now.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
