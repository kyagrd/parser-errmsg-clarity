Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." So my task is to figure out what's wrong with the code and correct it without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond the error message itself.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first, I notice that there are these weird symbols, 《 and 》. They look like they might be Chinese quotes or something else. In programming, we typically use curly braces { } to denote blocks of code inside an if statement. So maybe the user intended to use curly braces instead of those other characters.

So replacing 《 with { and 》 with } should fix that part. That would make it:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but then I see an extra closing brace at the end: 》. That's probably a mistake because the if statement only has one block. So removing that last } will prevent the syntax error.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

I think that makes sense now. The code inside the if is executed when x is greater than 0, and the else part executes when x is not. Also, using standard curly braces is the correct syntax for this in most programming languages like JavaScript or Python.
...done thinking.

The original code has issues with the use of 《 and 》 instead of proper curly braces { }, as well as an extra closing brace.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace 《 with {
2. Replace 》 with }
3. Remove the trailing } at the end
4. Proper syntax is achieved

The fixed code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
