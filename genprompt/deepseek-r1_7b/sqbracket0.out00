Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error" and the code that's supposed to be fixed:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, let me try to understand what's wrong here. I know that in programming languages like C or Java, when you have an if-else statement, each block inside the braces needs to be properly indented and closed correctly. 

Looking at the code, after the if condition, there's a closing brace ']' which is part of the first block. But then right after that, another closing brace ']' follows before the else statement. That doesn't seem right because in most languages, each if-else structure starts with an opening brace and ends with a closing one.

Wait, actually, I think the code might be using C-like syntax but missing some braces. Let me parse it again. The original code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So between the if condition and the else, there's an opening square bracket which isn't closed before the else statement. In many languages, you need to close all brackets properly. So maybe this code was supposed to have braces around the statements.

In C or Java, each block inside if-else must be enclosed within braces { } for better readability and to handle compound conditions. Here, the code uses square brackets [ ] which might not be recognized as part of the syntax unless it's specific to a certain context like arrays or something else, but in this case, they're used incorrectly.

So the correct way would be to replace those square brackets with curly braces. Let me rewrite that part:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That makes sense because now each block is properly enclosed within its own set of braces, and the syntax error should be fixed.

I also notice there's an extra closing brace at the end which isn't needed. The original code had two closing square brackets after the if-else statement, but since we're changing them to curly braces, those extra ] can be removed. So the corrected code is as above without any trailing ].
...done thinking.

The code has syntax errors due to mismatched and unnecessary square brackets instead of braces for block statements.

Here's the fixed code:

```csharp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Square brackets [ ] are not valid syntax in C# or similar languages when defining if-else blocks.
2. Replace square brackets with curly braces { }, which denote block scopes correctly.
3. Remove the trailing square bracket at the end of the original code as it's unnecessary and incorrect.

Fixed Code:
```csharp
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
