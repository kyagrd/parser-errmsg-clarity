Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which means the if statement was already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see that there are these symbols 《 and 》 used around the statements. Maybe they're some kind of comment markers or something? But in Python, comments start with #, so perhaps they're being misused here.

Looking closer, after the else clause, there's a closing brace 》 which doesn't belong. The if statement is already closed with 》 right after the condition. So having another 》 after else is causing the syntax error because it's expecting a colon or something to end the else part.

So I think the solution is to remove that extra 》 at the end. That should fix the issue because the else clause doesn't need another closing brace anymore.
...done thinking.

The code has an unexpected '》' character after the `else` clause which closes the if statement prematurely. Removing this misplaced character fixes the syntax error.

The fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;
```
