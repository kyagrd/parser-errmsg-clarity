Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error is a syntax error, so something's wrong with the structure or punctuation.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that there are two closing quotes after `else`. Normally, in programming languages like C, Java, or JavaScript, if you use curly braces `{}`, they must be properly opened and closed. Alternatively, using angle brackets `<>` might imply something different.

In the given code, the structure seems to be trying to assign a value based on a condition but is incorrectly closing the tags twice. The initial part has 《a =1;》 which looks like some kind of tag or syntax, maybe from a markup language, and then after else, it's adding another 》.

I think that in languages where you use curly braces for code blocks, these angle brackets might not be valid. So the extra closing bracket at the end is causing the error because there are two instead of one needed to close properly.

So, I should remove one of the extra closing quotes to fix the syntax.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
