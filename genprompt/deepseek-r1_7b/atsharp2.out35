Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I notice that there's a `#` symbol after the `else` statement. In many programming languages, `#` is used to comment out lines of code. But here, it's placed right after `else`, which might be causing an issue.

The error message says there's an unexpected `#` after the else clause. So maybe the `#` isn't meant to be a comment in this context. Perhaps it was supposed to separate two different statements or create a new block. But since the code has `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;`, it looks like the user might have intended to write something else there.

Wait, another possibility is that the `@` operator isn't correct in this context. In some languages, like R or certain others, `@` is used for matrix operations, but here it's probably not needed. Maybe it was an error and should be removed. So if I remove the `@`, the code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That makes more sense because now after the `else` clause, there are two separate conditions without any leftover `#` symbols.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a comment for some explanation. In that case, placing the comment correctly could help. But given the structure of the code, it's more likely that removing the `@` and adjusting the spacing would fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
