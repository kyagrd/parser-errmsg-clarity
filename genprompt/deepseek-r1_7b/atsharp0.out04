Thinking...
Alright, so I've got this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided the code and an error message, but they want me to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge—just based on the error message. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I see that there are two main parts here: an if statement and an else clause. But wait, in programming, especially in languages like C or C++, you can't have both if and else without a compound statement inside the braces. So maybe the syntax is wrong because it's missing those curly braces.

Also, I notice the @ symbol before 'a = 1;'. That doesn't look right. In C-like languages, operators are used differently than assignments. Maybe that should be removed or changed? Or perhaps it's a mistake and shouldn't be there.

Another thing is the '#' signs at the end of each line. Those are usually used for comments in some languages, but here they're probably causing unexpected behavior. So maybe those should be removed as well.

Putting this together: the code has an if statement without braces, which is invalid syntax because you need {} to enclose the block. Also, the @ and # signs are messing things up. Removing them might fix the syntax error.

So the corrected code should probably just have the if statement with the correct operator, like = instead of @=, and no comments at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
```
