Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code. The error message just says "syntax error," which is pretty vague. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I see that there's an if statement with a condition checking if x is greater than 0. Then after that, it uses a hash symbol '#' which I know is used for comments in Ruby. But here, the line starts with '@', which isn't something I recognize in this context.

Wait, maybe the '@' is part of some syntax related to Rails on Rails, where you can write code inline without using shebang or require statements. In that case, sometimes people use the @ sign before a block name like :each, but here it's followed by 'a = 1'. That doesn't look right.

So perhaps the user intended to write an if-else statement with some logic inside, but instead used '@' incorrectly. Maybe they meant to write code within a block or something else.

Looking closer, after the if condition, there's @ a = 1; which probably isn't valid Ruby syntax because 'a' is not defined in that context. Then there's a comment marker '#', and another line starting with '#' which might be intended as a comment but doesn't make much sense on its own.

I think what they're trying to do here is within an @block, maybe using block names like :each or something else. So perhaps the correct approach would be to use proper Ruby syntax for an if-else statement inside that block.

So I'll replace '@' with 'if', remove any unnecessary symbols, and make sure each line starts correctly without extra '#' signs unless they're meant as comments.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)
    a = 1
# else
    b = 2
end # close the if block
```
