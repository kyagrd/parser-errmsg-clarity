Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. Let me see what's wrong. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that it's using square brackets [ ] instead of parentheses or curly braces for the condition in an if statement. In many programming languages like C, Java, and Python, square brackets are used for array indexing, not for control structures. So using them here would cause a syntax error because they're expecting parentheses.

Looking at the structure, the code is trying to handle two cases: when x is greater than 0 and otherwise. It seems like it's meant to assign either a=1 or b=2 based on the condition. But in this case, the brackets are messing things up.

Wait, I remember that in some languages, you can use square brackets for objects or arrays with accessors, but here they're not used correctly. The code probably intended to use parentheses around the if condition. So changing [ ] to ( ) should fix it.

So replacing the opening bracket [ with an open parenthesis ( and the closing bracket ] with a close parenthesis ) should resolve the syntax error. Let me try that:

if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;

Wait, but now I see something odd. The code has two expressions after each condition: one inside the if block and another in the else. But in many languages, you can't have multiple statements without using proper control structures like curly braces.

But looking back at the original code, it's written as [ a = 1; ] which is more likely an array access with no key, so maybe that's not intended. Perhaps each case should just be a single statement. So maybe I need to adjust how it's structured.

Alternatively, perhaps using curly braces {} would make more sense here to group the statements correctly. Let me try rewriting it:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2; 
}

That way, each condition has its own block with proper syntax. But wait, in the original code, there was only one else statement without braces, which would cause issues because an else must have a corresponding if and can't be followed by another else.

So maybe the corrected version should use parentheses for the if condition and then properly structure each case's assignment within curly braces. That way, both conditions are clearly separated and valid.
...done thinking.

The code uses square brackets instead of parentheses around the `if` condition. We need to replace them with parentheses. Also, the original code is trying to assign a value based on two cases but it's not using proper control structures like curly braces. The fixed code should have the correct syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```

The final answer:
```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}
```
