Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message is just a syntax error, so something's wrong with the structure of the code. Let me look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, first, I notice that there are square brackets used instead of parentheses or braces. In many programming languages, if you're using an if-else statement, you typically use either parentheses for expressions or curly braces for blocks of code. Here, the user is using square brackets, which might not be valid syntax depending on the language.

Looking closer, the code inside the if condition has `[ a = 1; ]`, and then in the else clause, there's `b = 2; ]`. It seems like the closing brackets are mismatched. The outer if statement uses a single bracket, but maybe it should be using braces instead because they're more flexible for block structures.

So perhaps changing the square brackets to curly braces would fix the syntax. Let me try that:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, let me check if this makes sense. The if condition is correctly placed with parentheses. Then, inside the if block, I'm using curly braces which enclose the assignment statement `a = 1;`. In the else clause, since it's a single statement, I don't need the braces around `b = 2;` but I should still close the else properly without an extra closing bracket.

Looking at the original code again, after the if block, there was another closing square bracket and then `]`, which might have caused the syntax error because it's not matching. By replacing those with curly braces, the structure becomes correct.

Another thing to consider is whether the semicolons are properly placed. In each statement inside the braces, a semicolon is used correctly after each assignment or statement. So that seems fine.

I don't think there are any other syntax issues here. The main problem was the use of square brackets where curly braces were expected in an if-else block structure.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
