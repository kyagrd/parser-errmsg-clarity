Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me a syntax error. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, let me see where the problem might be. I remember that in programming, indentation and brackets are really important for syntax.

Looking at the first line: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]. Wait, after the if statement, there's an opening bracket [. Maybe it should just be a curly brace? So instead of [, it should probably be {. That would make sense because in JavaScript or similar languages, you use {} for blocks.

Then, looking at the else part: ] else b = 2; ]. There are two closing brackets here. That's not right because each block inside an if-else should have its own braces. So after the first } from the a=1 line, there should be another }, then else, and finally another } for the else block.

Putting that together, I think the code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Let me check if this makes sense. The if condition is correct. Then inside the curly braces, we have the assignment a=1. After that, another closing brace and then else with its own block for b=2. Yes, that looks right.

So the main issues were using square brackets instead of curly braces and having an extra closing bracket at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has two syntax errors: it uses square brackets where curly braces should be, and there's an extra closing bracket. The corrected code is:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
