Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at what the code says:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces here. The first if statement has one brace pair, and then after the else statement, there's another brace before the closing of the function or script. That's probably causing the syntax error.

Wait, in JavaScript, each block should have its own opening and closing braces. So right now, the code inside the if is correct with { a = 1; }, but then it closes the if block immediately after the else, which isn't right because there's no matching open brace for that second brace at the end.

So I think the issue is that there are too many braces. The original code probably meant to have an else block where b is set to 2. So maybe the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each condition has its own brace block. I removed the extra closing brace at the end and added one for the else statement. This should fix the syntax error because now all braces are properly matched.
...done thinking.

The code had an extra closing brace after the `else`, which was causing a syntax error. The correct code fixes this by adding another opening brace within the `else` block.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
