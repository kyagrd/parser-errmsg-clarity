Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this code that has a syntax error. The user provided the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And an error message saying there's a syntax error. Hmm, let me think about what's wrong here.

First, looking at the code structure. It starts with an if statement: if (x > 0). Then there's something that looks like a comment starting with @, which is not standard in many languages. Then another comment using #, and some lines afterward.

Wait, I remember that in C-like syntax, you can use /* ... */ for comments instead of just # or @. So maybe the code was intended to be using block comments. Also, the semicolons at the end of statements might not be necessary here because it's within a single-line if-else structure.

So putting it together: perhaps the code should be written with block comments and without extra semicolons on each line for clarity. That way, it's cleaner and avoids syntax issues.

Let me reconstruct that. The if statement would have an opening brace after the condition, then the code inside, followed by a closing brace. Then the else part would come right after. So removing the unnecessary @ and # comments might solve the problem.

Wait, but in the original code, there are two comment markers: one with @ and another with #. Maybe they were trying to create an if-else statement using block comments. If I remove them and use proper syntax for C or similar languages, it should fix the error.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each case is properly indented within its own block, there are no trailing semicolons on each line unless necessary, and the syntax should be correct.

I think that's it. The main issues were using @ instead of /* for comments and having extra semicolons.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
