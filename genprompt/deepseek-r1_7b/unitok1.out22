Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first off, I notice some strange characters here: 《 and 》. These are not standard brackets or quotes in Python. So that's probably where the error is coming from.

The code has an if statement with an else clause inside it, but then there's this '》' at the end which doesn't belong. Let me break down the structure:

if (x > 0)《 a =1; 》 else b=2;

Wait, no, looking again: The original code ends with two lines after the if and else clauses.

So it's written as:
if (condition):
    some code
》
else:
    some other code
》

But that '》' at the end is outside the else block. That's causing a syntax error because Python expects only one colon for each if statement.

I remember that in Python, after an else clause inside an if statement, you shouldn't have another closing bracket or parenthesis unless it's part of a tuple or similar structure. Here, those brackets are probably meant to be angle brackets but were incorrectly used.

So the solution should remove these extra 《 and 》 characters because they're causing the syntax error. The code should only have one pair of standard parentheses around the condition and another single line for else without any surrounding characters.

Let me rewrite it step by step:

Original incorrect lines:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I need to remove the '《' after if and the '》' after else. So it becomes:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

That makes sense now. Each block is properly indented, and there's only one closing bracket for each if statement.

I think that should fix the syntax error because the extra brackets were causing unexpected tokens in Python.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect angle brackets (《》) which are not valid in Python syntax. These need to be replaced with standard parentheses or removed since they don't serve any purpose here.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

Fixed Code:
```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
