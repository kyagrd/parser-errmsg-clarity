Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this code that has a syntax error. The user mentioned that it's different from languages like C, Java, or Python, but I don't know exactly what it's supposed to be. Let me look at the code they provided:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, first off, I notice there are two lines here separated by semicolons and some weird symbols like `@` and `#`. In regular programming languages, you usually have an if-else structure with proper indentation. But in this case, it's using these symbols which aren't standard.

The error message is just a syntax error, so probably something is wrong with how the code is structured or the characters used. Let me think about each part step by step.

Starting with the first line: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` The `@` symbol isn't familiar in most programming languages I know. Maybe it's supposed to be something else? Or perhaps it's a typo for another operator.

Then there's `# else b = 2; #`. The `#` symbols are usually used for comments, but here they're at the beginning of lines, which might be causing issues. Also, the else is indented and uses `@`, which doesn't make sense in an if-else block.

Wait, maybe this code isn't valid syntax for a specific language that allows certain operators or keywords. For example, in some languages like JavaScript, you can have ternary operators, but here it's using `@` instead of something else. Maybe the `@` is supposed to be part of an operator or keyword.

Alternatively, perhaps this code is meant to represent mathematical expressions where `if (x > 0)` leads to a calculation for `a`, and otherwise for `b`. But without knowing the target language, it's tricky.

Looking at the structure again, if I ignore the `@` and think about standard if-else syntax, maybe the code should be something like:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

That would make sense in many programming languages. So perhaps replacing the `@` with `{` starts and then adjust the line breaks and indentation.

But wait, in some languages like JavaScript, you can write:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

So maybe adding braces after the if statement would fix it. Also, removing the `@` and adjusting the line breaks with semicolons correctly.

Another thing is that in many languages, each line inside an if-else block should be properly indented. So I need to make sure that `a = 1;` is indented under the if statement and `b = 2;` is indented under else.

Putting it all together, perhaps the correct code would have braces after the if condition, followed by proper line breaks and indentation for each block.

So, fixing the syntax involves adding the opening brace `{` immediately after the if condition and then properly formatting the rest with semicolons on separate lines.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
