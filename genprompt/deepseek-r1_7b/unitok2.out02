Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code based on the provided error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me try to understand what's going wrong here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that there are some special characters like '《' and '》'. These look similar to angle brackets but might not be valid in this context. The error message mentions an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which suggests that these symbols aren't properly closed or used.

The code starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then there's a '《 a = 1; 》', followed by 'else b = 2; 》'. It seems like the developer is trying to use these angle-like brackets for some kind of block structure, maybe similar to how braces are used in other languages.

In many programming languages, including JavaScript and Python, we use curly braces `{}` to denote blocks. So perhaps replacing '《' with '{' and '》' with '}' would fix the syntax error. That makes sense because the code is probably intended to have an if-else structure using standard braces.

Let me rewrite the code accordingly:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This way, each block inside the if statement and else clause uses proper curly braces. The error should be resolved because the syntax now matches what's expected by the interpreter.

I also need to ensure that the opening brace is matched with the closing brace for both the inner statements and the outer if-else condition. By adding the extra braces, I'm making sure each block is correctly enclosed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
