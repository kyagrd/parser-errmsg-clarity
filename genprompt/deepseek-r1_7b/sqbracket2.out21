Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see that inside the if statement, there's a closing bracket ']', which is causing the problem because it's appearing right after the if block closes. Then, outside of that, there's another else clause with its own statement and a closing bracket.

Wait, in many programming languages like C or Java, an if-else structure only needs one closing brace, not two. So maybe this code is using syntax similar to those languages. Let me check the code again.

The original code has:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So inside the if block, there's an array or some kind of structure with a semicolon and closing bracket, then after that, the else statement is trying to have its own block. But this might be causing an extra closing bracket.

I think the issue is that the if statement closes properly with one ']', but then the else part has another ] which isn't needed because it's not inside any block. So I should remove that last ] after the else clause.

Let me rewrite the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

That way, the if statement closes with one ']', and the else doesn't have an unnecessary closing bracket. This should fix the syntax error because now there's only one ] after the if block.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing bracket `]` which is causing a syntax error. The fix involves removing this misplaced bracket so that each conditional statement (if or else) properly closes with its own bracket.

```fix
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
