Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which makes sense because if statements in Python don't use those angle brackets for comments or anything. Instead, they just end with a colon and then have indentation.

Looking at the code, I see that before the else statement, there's 《 and 》 around 'a = 1;'. That looks like Chinese punctuation—those are not valid in English syntax. So probably, those should be replaced with '/' or something else to make it a comment, but wait, in Python, you can have comments using #.

But looking closer, the error is about unexpected tokens after the else clause. The closing 》 after else b = 2; seems out of place because Python expects just a colon and then an indented block for the if-else structure.

So I think the issue is that those 《 and 》 are being used where they shouldn't be, possibly to denote comments or something else. Instead, maybe they were meant to be part of the code syntax but got replaced with invalid characters.

In Python, you can have a comment right after an if statement by using #. So perhaps replacing the 《 and 》 around 'a = 1;' with '#' would make sense here. That way, it's a comment explaining what happens when x is greater than 0.

So rewriting that part: instead of 《 a = 1; 》, we can put # a = 1;

Then the else statement should just have b = 2 without any extra tokens afterward because Python expects nothing after 'else' except the indented block. So removing the trailing 》 would fix the syntax error.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0):
    # a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

Wait, but in the original code, there was an extra space before the else clause. In Python, after 'if' and 'else', you can have optional whitespace, so maybe that's not necessary to fix.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0):
    # a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

I think this should resolve both issues: removing the invalid characters and ensuring proper syntax after else.
...done thinking.

The error was caused by incorrect use of '》' instead of Python's comment syntax. Replacing them with '#' fixes the issue.

```python
if (x > 0):
    # a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
