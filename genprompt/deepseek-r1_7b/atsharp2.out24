Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here that's causing a syntax error. The error message is "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I notice that there are some '#' symbols at the end. The error mentions an unexpected '#', so maybe those are causing issues. In many programming languages, '#' is used for comments or to start shebang lines. But in this context, it's probably not needed and might be messing up the code structure.

Wait, also after the else clause, there's a comment starting with '#'. So perhaps that's unnecessary here. Also, looking at the if statement, I see '@' is used before 'a = 1'. In languages like C or Java, we don't use '@' in if conditions; it's more of a compiler keyword. But since the error message mentions an unexpected '#' after else, maybe the problem is with the comments.

So I think the code should be cleaned up by removing those extra comment lines and possibly the '@' symbol if it's not part of the intended syntax here. Since the original code seems to mix some control structures (if-else) with other constructs like assignment operators in a way that might not make sense, perhaps the correct approach is to just write a simple if statement without any comments or unrelated symbols.

So I'll remove the '#'s and the '@' symbol. That should fix the syntax error because the else clause was already closed by the endif-like structure of the if statement, and the extra comments were unnecessary.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

The fixed code removes the '#' symbols which were causing syntax errors. The '@' symbol is also removed as it wasn't part of standard control structures in this context.

Step-by-step explanation:
- Removed extra comment lines ('#') after if statement, else clause, and at end.
- Removed '@' as it's not relevant to the given code structure.
- Simplified code to a basic if-else structure without unnecessary comments or symbols.
