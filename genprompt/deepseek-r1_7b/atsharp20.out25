Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and provided the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, looking at this, the first thing I notice is the use of '@' after 'if'. That doesn't look right in an if statement. Maybe it's some operator that isn't valid here.

Then there are these '#' symbols at the end. In programming, '#' can be used for comments or to denote the start of a shebang line. But here they're placed outside the if statement, which is odd because usually, statements should be within the code blocks defined by braces.

So, I think the '@' might not be correct. Perhaps it's a typo and should be removed. That leaves us with an if statement that doesn't have a body, which would still cause a syntax error because in many languages, you need to specify what happens when the condition is true or false.

Also, the '#' symbols at the end are probably meant to be comments, but they're misplaced. Maybe they should be removed so that the code isn't trying to execute anything after the if statement and else clause unnecessarily.

Putting it all together, I'll remove the '@' symbol because it's causing an error in the syntax of the if statement. Then, I'll remove the trailing '#' symbols since they're not needed here. That should fix the errors.
...done thinking.

The code has two issues: the `@` operator is invalid and the trailing `#` signs are unnecessary.

The fixed code removes `@` and the trailing `#`s:

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
- The `@` symbol isn't valid in an if statement.
- Remove the trailing `#` comments since they don't serve any purpose here.

The corrected code is now syntactically correct and properly structured.
