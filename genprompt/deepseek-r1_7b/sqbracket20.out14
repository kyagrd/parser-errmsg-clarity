Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The code given is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, let me break it down. The user says the error message is "syntax error," which means something's wrong with the structure of the code.

First, I notice that the if statement starts with 'if (x > 0)'. That part seems fine. Then there's a square bracket [ after the condition. In many programming languages like C or Java, square brackets are used for arrays or objects, so using them here might be incorrect syntax unless it's intended to do something else.

Looking at the code inside the if block: [ a = 1; ] So this is a block enclosed in square brackets. But in an if statement, each branch (the part when the condition is true and when it's false) should be separate statements without enclosing them in brackets unless we're using a specific feature that allows it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The code after the else is b = 2; but it's outside any block because there's no matching opening bracket for the closing ]. So the ] at the end of the if statement doesn't have anything to close. That would definitely cause a syntax error because the parser expects an end for that opening square bracket.

So, I think the main issues are:
1. The else clause is followed by b = 2; without any condition attached. It should probably be indented and at the same level as the if statement's block.
2. The square brackets around a = 1; might not be necessary unless we're using some specific syntax that allows for it, but in standard control structures, they aren't used like that.

Wait, actually, looking again, maybe the code is intended to use an else clause within a list or array because of those square brackets. But I'm not sure about that context. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to write this in a different language where square brackets are part of some syntax, but it's unclear.

But given the information and the error message, which just says "syntax error," without specifying what's wrong, I'll assume it's a simple indentation or block issue.

Let me try restructuring the code. The else should be aligned with the if statement at the same level as the else's block. Also, the square brackets around a = 1; and b = 2; might not be necessary unless they're part of some specific feature like an array initializer or something else that uses curly braces.

Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to use semicolons correctly. Wait, in many languages, you can have multiple statements on one line separated by semicolons. But here, the if statement has a block inside square brackets which is unusual. Maybe the code was intended to be part of an array or some other structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the user made a mistake with indentation and missing braces. The code starts with if (x>0) [ ... ] else b=2; without proper alignment. So perhaps removing the square brackets would fix it because they're not needed here unless for specific reasons.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was intended to use an array syntax where each condition is on a new line inside the square brackets. But in standard if statements, that's not how it works.

Wait, maybe I should just remove the square brackets and see if that fixes the issue. So instead of [a=1;], just have a semicolon at the end. Let me try:

if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;

That looks better because each statement is properly indented and separated by semicolons. Also, the else block doesn't need any square brackets around it.

So putting it all together, the fixed code would be aligning the else with its block and removing unnecessary square brackets.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect indentation and an improperly placed closing bracket. The if-else statement should be properly aligned without enclosing statements in square brackets unless specified by the language's syntax rules (which weren't provided).

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

The fixed code is:

if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
