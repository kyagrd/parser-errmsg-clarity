Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem carefully.

The user provided an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, so there's a character that's causing the issue here.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice that before the 'else' statement, they're using these symbols: 《 and 》. Those look like Unicode brackets. Then after the 'else', there's another 》.

Wait, maybe those are not necessary or perhaps incorrectly placed. In regular Python syntax, we don't use 《 or 》; it should be using parentheses for conditions and colons for statements.

So, the original code probably intended to have an if-else block but mistakenly used these brackets. Let me think about how it should look.

The correct structure would be:
if (condition):
    do something
else:
    do something else

But in the given code, they have 'if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》'. So replacing the 《 and 》 with nothing should fix it. That is, remove those characters.

Let me try rewriting that part:
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense. The extra brackets were causing the syntax error because Python expects only parentheses around conditions in if statements and proper colons for blocks.

So, removing those extra symbols should fix the issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
