Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error and provided the code along with an error message. My task is to fix the code based solely on the error message without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's necessary.

First, let me look at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that there are some issues here. The first thing that stands out is the closing braces. In the if statement, after `a = 1;`, the brace closes the block. Then, in the else part, it's written as `else b = 2; }` without a corresponding opening brace. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the code has an extra closing brace at the end.

Wait, let me parse this correctly. The if statement is from `{` after `(x >0)` to before the next `}` which closes both the if and else blocks. So the structure should be:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in the code given, it's written as:

if (...) { a =1; } else b=2; }

So the code after the else is just `b=2;` without braces, and then an extra closing brace at the end. That's probably why there's a syntax error.

Wait, no, let me count the braces again. The if block has `{ ... }`, which includes `a =1;`. Then outside that, it's written as `else b=2;}` but this else is part of the outer if statement? Or is it another if-else?

No, actually, in the code, after the initial if-else structure, there's an extra closing brace. So let me see:

The original code starts with `if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }`

So the opening brace is after `a=1;`, then the else part has `b=2;` and ends with another brace.

Wait, but that's not correct because in JavaScript or similar languages, each if-else structure must have braces matching. So the initial if statement starts at `{` and closes at `}`, which includes the a=1 line. Then outside that, we should have the else part starting with an opening brace. But here, after else b=2; it's closing with a `}` again without a corresponding block.

So in the given code, there are two issues:

1. The else statement is written without braces around its body.
2. There's an extra closing brace at the end which doesn't match any if or else block.

Wait, but looking more carefully, the structure is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

So after the initial if, there's one }, then the else part is written as `else b=2; }` with another brace at the end. So that's two closing braces in a row, which would cause a syntax error because each opening brace must have a corresponding closing brace.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

So without an extra closing brace at the end. Or maybe it's more accurate to say that after the if-else block, there should not be another `}` because the previous one already closed.

Wait, let me break it down:

The code starts with:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

Here, the first brace opens for the if statement and ends at its corresponding closing brace. Then after that, we have an else followed by `b=2;` without braces, which is invalid because else needs to be followed by a block enclosed in braces.

Additionally, there's another `}` at the end, making it three braces: one opening for if, one closing (which ends the if), then the else with its own brace? No, wait. The code as written has:

if (...) { ... } else b=2; }

Which is incorrect because after the initial }, we have an else that doesn't start a block, and then another }, which would cause two closing braces in a row without matching blocks.

So to fix this, I need to adjust the code so that each brace is properly matched. The correct structure should be:

if (...) { ... } else { ... }

Without any trailing or missing braces.

Looking back at the user's provided code, they have an extra `}` at the end. So perhaps removing that would fix it.

Alternatively, maybe the code was intended to have both branches with braces but is mistakenly written without for the else part.

So in summary:

The issues are:
1. The else statement is not enclosed in braces.
2. There's an extra closing brace after the else, leading to a syntax error.

To fix this, I should enclose the else statement within braces and remove the trailing brace.

Thus, rewriting the code as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each if-else block has its own braces, and there's no extra closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
