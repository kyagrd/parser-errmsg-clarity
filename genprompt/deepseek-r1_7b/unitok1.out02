Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I have to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and some code. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a Unicode issue because '》' is not a standard character in most programming languages. I know that in English, we use '>' as the greater than sign. So maybe this code was written with some form of Chinese punctuation or a mix of languages?

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I can see there's an 'else' block here. The structure is: if (condition) { ... } else { ... }. But in this code, instead of curly braces {}, it seems to be using these symbols 《 and 》. Oh, right! Those are the full-width versions of < and >, often used in Chinese text but might have been accidentally included here.

So the line starts with if (x>0) then a block that's supposed to be the else part, which is written as 《 ... } instead of { ... }. But looking closely, I see that after '》' comes another 》 at the end. That second one is probably causing an error because it's not expecting anything there.

Let me break down the code line by line:

1. if (x > 0) — okay, correct syntax.
2. 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Wait, after the first } from the else clause, why is there another 》? That's probably an error because the parser expects nothing or maybe an operator after that.

So the mistake here is using 《 and 》 instead of curly braces { and }. Also, there's an extra closing bracket at the end which isn't needed. So I should replace 《 with { and 》 with }, but more importantly, correct the line so it doesn't have two } in a row.

The corrected code should be replacing both symbols to use standard curly braces for the if statement block. That way, the syntax is correct without any extra characters causing errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
