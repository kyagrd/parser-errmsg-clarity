Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which suggests there's a mismatched bracket somewhere. Let me look at the code again: 

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see. The if statement is correctly opened with parentheses and closed properly with ]. But then there's an else clause followed by a semicolon and another ]. That must be the issue.

Wait, in the code, after the else, it says 'else b = 2; ]'. Oh, so the user probably intended to close the else block but forgot to do so correctly. Let me break it down:

The if condition is (x > 0), which is fine. Then there's an opening square bracket [ after that, and inside, a = 1; followed by a closing ]. So that part seems okay because each bracket pair matches.

But then comes the else clause: 'else b = 2; ]'. Here, the else is outside any brackets, but it's followed by a semicolon and another ]. That doesn't make sense. The else statement should either be inside a block (like if-else with braces) or correctly paired with something.

So maybe the user intended to have an if-else where only the if part has the [ ] block. So perhaps they meant:

if (x > 0) [ ... ]
else b = 2;

But in the code, they have two closing brackets: one after else and another before 'else'. Let me check again.

Looking at the original code:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I think the user mistakenly added an extra ] at the end. So the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But wait, in many programming languages like JavaScript or PHP, after if-else, you don't need to close with brackets unless you have multiple statements inside, which is done using braces {}.

Alternatively, maybe the code was written using an older style where square brackets were used for arrays, but here it's part of a condition. It seems more likely that the user intended to use braces { } instead of [ ] for the if block.

Wait no, in PHP, you can't use square brackets like arrays inside conditions without appropriate operators (e.g., isset, array_key_exists). So perhaps they meant to write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But the original code has [ and ], which isn't valid syntax for PHP in this context. So another approach is that if only one statement is inside the if, you can omit braces, but here they have an else statement after.

So maybe the user intended to write:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] 
else b = 2;

But since the else doesn't have any block, it's not needed. So perhaps removing the else part or correcting it.

Wait, looking back at the error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". This means that there's an extra closing bracket after else, which doesn't correspond to a previous one.

So in the code, after else b = 2; there's another ], making it '] ]'. That's wrong. So the correct way is to remove that extra ]. Let me check:

Original line: ... ] else b = 2; ]

So between else and ; there are two brackets: ' ] else b = 2; ]'—that can't be right.

Wait, no. The code is written as:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Breaking it down:
- if (x>0) [
- ... statements
- ]
- else b=2;
- ]

So the last ] doesn't have anything before it, which causes the parser to think there's an unexpected ].

Wait no, in the code as written:

The user has after 'else' a semicolon and then another ]. So the line is: else b = 2; ]

That means two closing brackets at the end. But only one was needed. So I need to remove that extra bracket.

So the corrected line should be else b = 2;

Therefore, the entire code would have:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But wait, in PHP, using square brackets inside if statements is only allowed with specific operators. Alternatively, perhaps they intended to use braces.

So another approach: maybe replacing the [ ] with { } for the if block.

In that case:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That would be correct and avoid any syntax errors.

Alternatively, since only one statement is inside the if, it can be written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But perhaps that's more readable. So to fix the code, either change [ ] to { }, or adjust the placement of brackets correctly.

So putting it all together, I think replacing the square brackets with braces would be the correct approach.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there are mismatched square brackets and an extra closing bracket after `else`. The brackets in PHP should use curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets `[ ]` for code blocks. Here's the fixed version:

```php
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Alternatively, if you want to keep using square brackets correctly:

```php
if (x > 0) [a = 1;] else [b = 2];
```

But the first option is clearer and more standard.

The final fixed code inside backticks:
```php
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
