Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, it looks like the user is using square brackets for something that doesn't make sense in normal programming languages. Maybe they're trying to use an array or some kind of list here.

Wait, the error mentions an unexpected ']', so perhaps there's an extra bracket closing that shouldn't be there. Let me count the brackets:

The code starts with (x > 0) [ ... ] else b = 2; ]

So after the if statement, there are square brackets around a = 1;, then an else clause and another ]. But in normal syntax, the if-else block should only have one closing brace or bracket. So maybe that extra ] is causing the problem.

Let me think: In many programming languages like JavaScript or C++, you don't use square brackets for conditionals; instead, they're parentheses. So perhaps this code was intended to be in a different syntax where square brackets are used, but it's not properly closed.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant to use curly braces { } for block structure. If that's the case, then changing [ ] to { } would fix the issue because you only need one closing brace after the else.

So looking at the code: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

If I remove the extra ], it becomes:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But wait, that might leave an open bracket. So maybe replacing the square brackets with curly braces would be better.

Alternatively, if the code is using some custom syntax where [a=1] represents an array or something and then closes it after the if statement, but perhaps the indentation or nesting is causing issues.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the user intended to write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in their code, they used square brackets instead of braces. So replacing [ ] with { } might fix it.

So I'll change all instances of [] to {} and see if that works.

Let me rewrite the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But wait, in this case, after the if statement, there's only one closing brace for both conditions. That makes sense because each condition is on its own line with their respective braces.

Alternatively, perhaps they meant to have an array inside the if condition and another part for else, but that might not be necessary. So maybe just removing the square brackets and using curly braces is better.

So the fixed code would replace [ ] with { }, and remove the extra ] at the end.

Therefore, the corrected code should look like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But to match the exact structure of the user's original code, maybe just changing [a=1;] to {a=1;} and ensuring there are no extra brackets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's as simple as removing the square bracket after the if statement. Let me check:

Original line: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

If I remove the last ], then the code becomes:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But that leaves an open square bracket, which is still invalid.

So perhaps replacing the brackets with braces is the correct approach. So in this case, changing both instances of [] to {} and removing the last ].

Thus, the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but that's not exactly matching the user's original formatting because they had [ a=1; ] after if. So maybe it's better to keep the structure as much as possible while fixing the syntax.

Another possibility: The code might be using JavaScript-like syntax with square brackets for arrays inside an object or something else. But in this case, perhaps the brackets were intended to group statements but are causing a closing bracket where there shouldn't be one.

So after considering all options, I think replacing [a=1;] with {a=1;} and removing the extra ] would fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

The fixed code replaces the square brackets with curly braces to properly enclose the statements within the if-else block, ensuring there are no unmatched brackets.

if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}

This version uses curly braces which are more commonly used in JavaScript-like syntax for defining blocks. It removes the extra closing bracket and keeps the structure consistent.

Answer:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
