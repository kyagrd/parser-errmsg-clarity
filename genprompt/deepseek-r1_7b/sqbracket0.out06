Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, first off, I remember that in programming, especially in languages like C or JavaScript, an if statement has to have a block of code inside the parentheses. The structure usually looks like `if (condition) { ... }` for curly braces, but sometimes people use square brackets which might be part of another syntax.

Looking at the code, after `(x > 0)`, there's `[ a = 1; ]`. Wait, that [ is probably not needed. Because in an if statement, you don't include it as part of the condition. The condition is just what's inside the parentheses. So maybe those square brackets are causing issues.

Then there's `else b = 2; ]`. Again, the else statement should have a block following it with curly braces or another appropriate syntax. Here, they're using `]` which doesn't make sense because the previous part already had a `]`.

Putting this together, I think the main issues are:
1. The `[` after the condition is unnecessary and incorrect.
2. The `else b = 2; ]` should have curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets to form a proper code block.

So the corrected code would remove the `[` and add `{ }` around both the if part and the else part. Let me try that:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Yes, that looks right now. Each block is enclosed in curly braces, which should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect syntax due to misplaced brackets. The square brackets after `if` and before `else` are unnecessary. Instead, we use curly braces `{}` to define the scope of each statement.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
