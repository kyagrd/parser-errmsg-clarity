Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means a bracket is closing too early or in the wrong place.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I notice that after the if statement, there's a square bracket. The code inside the if block is `a = 1;`, and then there's an else clause followed by another ]. 

The problem seems to be that the first ] closes the if block incorrectly because it's not part of any function or array definition here. Instead, it should properly close the if statement.

So, I'll remove the opening [ after the if condition since we don't have a compound structure like an array or an object that needs braces. Then, I'll ensure that only one ] remains to close the else clause correctly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else b = 2;
```
