Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and then showed some code that's supposed to be fixed. Let me try to understand what's going on.

Looking at the code given:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I see an if statement with conditions. The first line is `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` and then there's another line starting with `else`. Wait, in programming languages like C or Python, indentation matters for blocks of code. But here, the else isn't indented properly under the if.

Also, I notice that after the if statement, there are some operators: `@ a = 1;` and `else b = 2;`. The @ symbol catches my eye because in many languages, like C or Python, it's used for pointers or decorators. But without knowing the specific language, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a typo.

Wait, looking at the code again, maybe the operators are part of some syntax that doesn't make sense together. The `@` followed by an assignment operator might be causing issues because in C-like languages, you can only have one expression after @ before the = sign. So something like `@a=1;` is invalid if it's supposed to assign a value.

So putting this together: the code has two separate statements inside what looks like an if block, but they're not properly indented and also might have syntax errors because of how the operators are used.

To fix this, I think the `else` statement needs to be correctly aligned under its corresponding if. Also, maybe the @ operator is being misused here. If we assume that it's a typo for something else, perhaps just removing it or using it properly would help.

Let me try restructuring the code:

1. Properly indent the else block.
2. Remove the @ since it doesn't make sense in this context without knowing what language this is supposed to be for. Alternatively, if @ was intended for a specific purpose like compiling C code with GCC, but that's probably not needed here.

So the corrected code would have the else statement correctly indented under the if and remove the @ operator since it seems out of place.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
