Thinking...
Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and some code, but it's all within triple backquotes which probably means it's part of a code block they want me to fix. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, looking at the error message: "syntax error". That tells me there's something wrong with the way the code is structured. The code given is:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement has some syntax issues. The parts before and after the curly braces are written with these fancy brackets 《 and 》, which aren't standard in programming languages like JavaScript or Python. Those should probably be regular curly braces {} instead.

So, breaking it down: the line starts with an if condition checking if x is greater than zero. Then there's a part where they're trying to set 'a' equal to 1 using 《 a = 1; 》. But this isn't correct because in JavaScript or similar languages, you can't use these symbols as braces; they have special meanings. Also, the way it's written seems like it might be inside an else block incorrectly.

Looking at the code again: after the if (x>0), there's a closing brace 》 which is not matching correctly with the opening brace of the if statement. It looks like the structure is messed up because they're trying to close both the if and another else clause within the same line, but it's not properly nested.

I think the main issues are:
1. Using 《 and 》 instead of regular { and }.
2. Incorrect placement or nesting of braces which causes syntax errors.

So, I should replace those fancy symbols with standard curly braces. Let me visualize how that would look:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Yes, that makes sense now. The if statement checks if x is greater than zero and assigns a=1 inside the block. If not, it assigns b=2 in the else block.

I also need to make sure that each brace is correctly matched with its corresponding pair without any nesting issues or missing braces which could cause the parser to throw an error.

So, putting it all together, replacing the 《 and 》 with { and }, ensuring proper indentation for readability isn't necessary here since it's just fixing syntax, but correct placement is key. This should resolve the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed within its own curly braces without any mismatched or misplaced symbols.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
