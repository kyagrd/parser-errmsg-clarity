Thinking...
Alright, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error" and the code they're looking at is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. I know that in programming, especially in languages like C++, we use syntax to structure our code correctly. The user mentioned they can't use any pre-trained knowledge except the error message, so I have to figure it out based on what's given.

Looking at the code, I see an if statement with a condition (x > 0). Then there are these symbols: 《 and 》 which seem to be used in place of standard braces. Maybe they're trying to use Chinese punctuation marks for some reason? But in C++, we have to use curly braces {}.

So the code has "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". Let me count the brackets and braces to see where it's off. The if statement should open with {, then inside, there's an a=1;, followed by }, but in this code, they're using 《 instead of {. Then for the else clause, which is another level up, so maybe another pair of curly braces?

Wait, let me visualize the structure:

- Line 1: if (x > 0) — condition opens with a parenthesis. Wait, parentheses are correct here.
- Line 2: 《 a = 1; — So they're using a left Chinese punctuation before {a=1;}? Or is it that their code has mismatched braces?
Wait, actually, looking closer, the if block starts with 《 which might not be recognized as an opening brace. Then inside, there's a semicolon and another 》 closing what seems like the if's body.

Then the else clause is written as "else b = 2;". But after that, there's another 》 which probably should close the if statement itself.

So the problem is that they're using these Chinese-style punctuation marks for braces. Instead of { and }, they used 《 and 》, but those are not recognized in C++. So that causes a syntax error because the compiler doesn't understand them as opening or closing braces.

To fix this, I should replace all instances of 《 with { and 》 with }. Let's see:

Original code:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

After replacing:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Now, let me check the structure. The if block starts with { and ends with }, which is correct. Then inside, the else statement uses its own braces correctly.

So the fixed code should have each 《 replaced by { and each 》 replaced by }. That way, all braces are properly opened and closed in the correct order, which should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code incorrectly used Chinese punctuation marks (《 and 》) instead of standard curly braces ({ and }). These characters are not recognized as part of C++ syntax. To fix the issue, replace each 《 with { and each 》 with }.

```c++
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
