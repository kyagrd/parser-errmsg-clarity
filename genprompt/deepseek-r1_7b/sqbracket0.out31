Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error and provided the code snippet along with an empty output example where I should only include the corrected code within triple backticks.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice a few issues here. First, after the if statement's condition, there's a square bracket and an else block inside it. That doesn't look right because in an if-else structure, both branches should be properly enclosed, usually with curly braces.

Wait, actually, looking closer, the code has "if (x > 0) [ ... ] else b = 2; ]". The brackets around 'a=1' and the lack of a closing brace might be causing the syntax error. Typically, in JavaScript or similar languages, after an if condition, you'd use curly braces to enclose both the true and false parts.

So perhaps the code was intended to have two branches: one where x is greater than 0, set a=1, and else set b=2. But as written, it's missing proper braces. Let me visualize how this should look.

The corrected code should probably be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense. The original code had square brackets and an extra closing bracket at the end, which is incorrect syntax because you can't have [a=1; ] without corresponding braces.

So I need to replace those brackets with curly braces for both the if block and the else block. Also, adding a space after 'if' might make it look cleaner, though technically not necessary in all cases. But it's good practice.

Putting it all together, the fixed code should have each branch enclosed within curly braces. That should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
