Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, okay, I see that inside the if condition, there's a square bracket and some code, then an else statement followed by another ]. The error is pointing out that there's an extra ] which isn't needed.

Let me break it down. In JavaScript, when you have control structures like if-else, you don't use square brackets for the body unless they're part of a function or array syntax. So in this case, [ a = 1; ] is incorrect because it's using brackets where they shouldn't be.

The code probably meant to write an if statement with an else block without using the [] syntax. So removing those square brackets should fix the issue.

So the corrected code would remove both sets of brackets around a=1 and before b=2, resulting in:

if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else b = 2;

Wait, but looking back, maybe it's supposed to be an if-else statement with each block having its own semicolon. So removing the square brackets would make more sense.

So the fixed code should look like:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense because without the brackets, it's just two separate statements inside the if and else blocks respectively.
...done thinking.

The error occurred due to the unnecessary use of square brackets around the assignments. These are removed as they aren't required for simple statement blocks in an if-else structure.

```fix
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
