Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and the code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Looking at this, I notice that inside the if condition, they have [a = 1; ]. Usually, in programming, square brackets are used for arrays or lists. But here, it's placed after the parenthesis of the if statement without being part of a control structure like an array index.

Wait, maybe they meant to use it as an else block. So perhaps they intended to write something like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in their code, the braces are missing. The square brackets don't make sense here because they're not followed by anything inside. I think the error is that they used [a=1;] without curly braces or parentheses.

So to fix it, maybe they should change the square brackets to regular braces. Let me check:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That makes more sense. The if condition is properly closed with curly braces, and then the else statement follows correctly without any syntax errors.

I also need to make sure that each line ends with a semicolon, so adding semicolons where necessary.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, in the original code, the else statement was written as else b=2; ] which had an extra closing bracket. So perhaps they wanted to close the if block correctly.

So putting it all together, replacing [ with { and adding braces for both blocks.
...done thinking.

The syntax error is due to using square brackets where curly braces should be used. Here's the fixed code:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

The corrected code uses curly braces `{}` around the if-else statements since they are not part of an array or object access. This fixes the syntax error by properly enclosing the block of code to be executed when conditions are met.
