Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that has a syntax error, and I need to fix it using only the error message provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, looking at the error message, it's just a "syntax error." That usually means there's something wrong with the structure of the code.

First, I notice that the code uses these angle brackets: 《 and 》. In JavaScript, those aren't valid syntax elements for comments or anything else. So maybe they're being used incorrectly here.

In an if-else statement, after the closing brace of the if block, you can have an optional closing parenthesis, but in this case, it looks like someone is trying to use a comment instead. Oh right! In JavaScript, when writing code inside brackets for comments, you should enclose them with /* */ not 《 and 》.

So the line "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》" probably meant to be a block comment but used angle brackets instead. So I'll replace those with /* and */.

Next, looking at the else part: "else b = 2;". That's outside the if statement because of the extra closing brace. The original code has two closing braces at the end: 》 after the first and another one before ending. But in JavaScript, each if-else should have its own block.

Wait, let me count the braces. There are three closing braces: one after a =1; then another at the end of else line, and a third one as the last character. That's definitely wrong. Each statement inside an if or else must be enclosed in its own braces.

So I need to adjust that. The correct structure should have each block inside if and else within their own braces.

Putting it all together: after fixing the comment syntax and removing the extra brace, the code should look like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That makes sense. Each condition has its own block with proper braces, and the comments are removed because they're not needed in that context.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
