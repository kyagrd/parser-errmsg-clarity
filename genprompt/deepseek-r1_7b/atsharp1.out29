Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I notice that there are some `#` symbols here. In programming, especially in languages like C or using shebang lines with `#!/usr/bin/env`, the `#` is used to comment out lines. But when it's placed after an if statement and its colon, it might be causing an issue because the interpreter thinks it's a shebang line.

So, I think the problem is that the code has two `#` symbols at the end of each line inside the if-else block. These are interpreted as shebang lines, which isn't valid here because they're not part of a script. So, removing those should fix the error.

Let me try removing both `#`s from the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Now, the code doesn't have any shebang lines anymore, and it's just one line with an if-else statement. This should compile without errors because it's correctly formatted.

I should also check if there are any other syntax issues, but in this case, after removing the `#`s, everything seems fine. So, the corrected code is as above.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
