Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message which is just a "syntax error." My task is to look at the code and figure out what's wrong without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's in the code itself.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces `}`. The first if statement has one brace `{` which is correct because it's enclosed within the function or block. Then there's an else clause without any opening brace `{`, and then another `}` at the end.

Wait, no, actually, in the code provided, after the if statement's brace closes with `{}`, the else part is written as `else b = 2; }`. So it looks like there are two closing braces: one at the end of the if block and another at the end of the entire code. That would cause a syntax error because each opening brace must have a corresponding closing brace.

So, to fix this, I should remove the extra closing brace `}` that's at the end of the code. Let me rewrite the code without that last `}`. So it should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
