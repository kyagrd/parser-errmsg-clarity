Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this code syntax error. Let me look at what's given. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause. Hmm, that means somewhere in the code, a '#' appears where it shouldn't.

Looking at the code, I see two lines after the if statement. The first line is inside the if block: @a=1;. Then there's another line with # else b=2; and then another #. Wait, but in programming, the else clause doesn't end with a semicolon like that. Instead, it should be indented under its condition.

I think the code might have some syntax mixed up because of how comments are used here. The @ symbol could be part of an annotation or maybe something else entirely. But since there's a # in the wrong place, I need to figure out where it belongs.

The error is pointing right after the else clause, so maybe the line breaks and comment placements are off. Perhaps the first line inside if is correct, but the else line shouldn't have a # at the beginning because that would create an unexpected comment outside of any block or statement.

So I should remove those # symbols from the lines where they're causing issues. That means taking out both #s so they don't appear after statements and cause syntax errors.

After fixing, the code should look like:

if (x > 0) @a = 1;
else b = 2;

Wait, but in many languages, each block ends with a semicolon. In this case, maybe the first line is correct because it's ending with ;, so I just need to fix the else part.

Yes, removing both # symbols should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @a = 1;
else b = 2;
```
