Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which suggests a problem with braces placement.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that after the if statement, there are square brackets instead of curly braces. In many programming languages, square brackets aren't used for blocks; they're usually for arrays or dictionaries. So using them here is incorrect.

The code has an opening [ after the if condition and a closing ] right after. Then, the else clause comes with another ; and another ]. The extra ] at the end is causing the error because it's unexpected.

So, I think replacing the square brackets with curly braces should fix the issue. That means changing [ a = 1; ] to { a = 1; }.

Let me rewrite the code accordingly:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Now, checking the structure: each block has its own braces and they're properly closed before the next statement. This should eliminate the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
