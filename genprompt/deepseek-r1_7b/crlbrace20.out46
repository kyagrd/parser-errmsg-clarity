Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and then showed some code that doesn't look right. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement starts with 'if (x > 0) {' which seems okay. Then inside the curly braces, there's an assignment `a = 1;` followed by closing the brace and then an else clause without a condition.

Wait, in most programming languages like C or Java, the syntax is different. For example, in if-else statements, you need to have the condition specified after 'else'. So the code as it is written doesn't follow that structure because it's missing the condition for the else part.

Let me check each line:

1. The first line is an if statement: `if (x > 0) {` — this looks correct.
2. Inside the braces, there's an assignment: `a = 1;` — okay, but that's inside the if block.
3. Then it closes the brace: `}` — so after the if block ends.
4. Next line is `else b = 2; }` — wait, this doesn't look right because else needs a condition. Also, there's an extra closing brace at the end.

So I think the main issues are:

- The else statement lacks a condition. In most languages, it should be written as `else if (condition) { ... }`.
- There's an extra closing brace after the else statement which is causing a syntax error because the code block isn't properly closed.

To fix this, I need to adjust how the else clause is structured. Instead of having 'else' without a condition, it should be part of an if-else structure. So perhaps combining both conditions into one if-else if statement or restructuring the code correctly.

Wait, but looking again, maybe the original intention was to have separate blocks for each condition. However, in most programming languages, you can't just have `a = 1;` inside an if block and then an else with a separate assignment without a condition unless it's part of an else if chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write separate if-else statements but didn't structure them correctly. But looking at the code, it seems like there might be two separate ifs: one for when x>0 and another in the else block setting b=2. However, that doesn't make much sense because else is used within a single if statement's block.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to write an if-else where each has its own assignment but without nesting. So maybe they meant:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in their code, after the first brace closes, they have `else b = 2; }` which is incorrect because there's no opening brace for the else block.

So to fix it, I need to add an opening brace `{` right after `else`, then close it properly. Also, remove any trailing braces or semicolons that might be causing issues.

Another point: in some languages like JavaScript, you can have multiple statements inside if and else blocks without needing to enclose them in braces, but since the user mentioned that the syntax might differ from C, Java, etc., maybe they're using a language where else must be followed by a condition. Or perhaps it's more about the structure than the specific language.

Alternatively, considering the error message is just 'syntax error', which often points to missing braces or incorrect statements.

So putting it all together, the code should have an if statement with its own block and an else if another block, but in this case, maybe they want a separate if-else structure. But looking at their code again:

The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

This seems to have two issues: the 'else' is not part of an if condition and there's an extra closing brace.

So fixing it would involve adding braces after else. Let me adjust that.

The corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But looking at the original code, perhaps they intended to have two separate if-else statements or just assign different variables based on conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an if with one assignment and then an else with another.

Wait, but in that case, each condition would be handled by its own block. So adding braces correctly around each statement is essential.

So the main changes are:

1. Add a `{` after `else`.
2. Remove any trailing semicolons or extra closing braces to fix syntax.
3. Ensure each block has its opening and closing braces.

Therefore, the corrected code would have proper braces for both if and else blocks.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {a = 1;}
else {b = 2;}
```
