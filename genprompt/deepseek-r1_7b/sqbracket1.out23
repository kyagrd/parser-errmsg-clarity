Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I remember that braces {} are used to group statements in JavaScript. So when using if-else, they should be within curly braces. 

In the current code, after the else statement, there's another ]. It looks like an extra closing brace was added incorrectly.

Wait, let me parse it step by step. The initial part is if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] — that seems off because inside the brackets [], which isn't necessary for single statements. Oh right, in ES6, we can use semicolons and braces even without the curly braces around a single statement.

But actually, when using [] after else, it's probably incorrect syntax. So maybe I should replace those square brackets with curly braces to fix the structure.

So the corrected code would be:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

I think that's better because now each condition has its own block, and it follows proper JavaScript syntax.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there are mismatched square brackets instead of curly braces. To fix this, replace the square brackets with curly braces.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace `[]` after `if (x > 0)` with `{}` to properly group statements in an if block.
2. Do the same for the else clause by replacing its surrounding brackets.
3. Remove the trailing `]` that was incorrectly added at the end of the code.

The fixed code:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Answer: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
