Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me take a look at what's provided.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, okay, first off, I see that it's using an if-else statement. The structure looks like `if (condition) [ ... ] else ...`. Wait, but in programming languages, the syntax for an if statement usually has braces `{}` around the block of code inside. Here, instead of braces, there are square brackets used.

Looking at the error message, it's a syntax error. So probably, using square brackets where they shouldn't be is causing the issue. In most languages like JavaScript or Python, we use curly braces `{}` for blocks.

So in this case, replacing the square brackets with curly braces should fix it. Let me check:

Original code: `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`
Should become: `{ a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

Wait, but I also notice that after the if block, there's an `else` statement without any braces for its block. So adding braces for both the if and else blocks should resolve the syntax error.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Yes, that makes sense. The square brackets were incorrect, so replacing them with curly braces fixes the syntax.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error in the provided code, we need to replace the square brackets `[]` used for the if statement block with curly braces `{}`.

The original code is:
```fix
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Here's how it's fixed:

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue:** The use of square brackets `[ ]` instead of curly braces `{}` for defining code blocks in an `if-else` statement is causing a syntax error.

2. **Replace Brackets with Curly Braces:**
   - Change `[ a = 1; ]` to `{ a = 1; }`.
   - Ensure the else clause also has its own block by adding braces around `b = 2`.

3. **Final Code:** The corrected code now uses proper syntax for defining if-else blocks with curly braces.

**Fixed code:**
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```
