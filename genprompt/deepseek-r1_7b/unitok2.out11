Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let's look at the problem step by step.

The user mentioned an error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So there's something wrong with the closing brackets here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that there are two sets of brackets: '《' and '》'. In many programming languages, especially those inspired by C or similar, these symbols might be used for comments. But here, they're incorrectly placed around the conditions.

The code seems to have an if-else statement. The structure should be:

if (condition) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}

But in this case, the brackets are messed up. Let's see: after 'if (x > 0)' there's a space and then '《', which probably isn't needed here. Then inside the if block is 'a=1;》, which seems to be closing the if incorrectly.

Then outside, there's an else followed by another incorrect bracket placement with '》'.

Wait, maybe the code uses angle brackets for comments or annotations. But looking at the error message, it says unexpected '》' after else, which suggests that the else is followed by a closing bracket where it shouldn't be.

So perhaps the code should have proper braces {} instead of these 《 and 》 symbols. Because in many languages like C++, Java, etc., you use { } for blocks.

Let me count the brackets:

The original code has: if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2; 》

So it's like: if block ends with 》, then else starts and also is followed by 》. That doesn't make sense because after else, there should be another block enclosed in braces or brackets.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use curly braces {} for the code blocks. So replacing 《 with { and 》 with } might fix it.

Let me rewrite:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That makes sense. The if block is from { until }, same for else. Also, the extra closing bracket at the end was causing the error because after else, there's no more code except for that incorrect }.

So replacing all instances of 《 with { and 》 with } should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
