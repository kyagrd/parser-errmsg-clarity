Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means a closing brace was found where it wasn't expected. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I see that the if statement is correctly opened with { and closed with }, but then there's an else clause followed by another semicolon and assignment. Wait, after the first closing brace of the if statement, there's an else statement without any braces around it. That might be causing the error because the else isn't part of the if block.

So, probably, the code is trying to have both branches inside the if, but that's not valid syntax in many languages. Let me think about how this would look correctly. In some languages like C or JavaScript, you need braces for each condition inside an if-else statement.

Wait, maybe the original code was intended to write two separate conditions using if and elseIf, but it's written as else without any braces. Alternatively, perhaps the code is meant to have both branches within the same block, which isn't allowed in languages where you need braces for compound statements.

Looking back at the code: after the first closing brace }, there's an else followed by b=2; and then another }. But that would mean that the else statement is outside the if's block, but how?

Wait, maybe the original code was:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

But without braces around 'else ...', so when the compiler parses it, after the first }, it finds an else which isn't part of any condition. So that's why there's an unexpected '}'.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that both branches (the if and else) have their own braces correctly closed.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be written with separate conditions using elseif instead of else, but in some languages like JavaScript or C, you can't write else without a block unless it's an if-else expression. But I'm not sure about the context here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the original code is trying to have multiple statements inside each branch. So perhaps after the if statement, both branches should have their own braces.

But in this case, the else part isn't indented or structured correctly. Let me think about how it's supposed to be written. Maybe the correct way is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, both branches have their own braces.

Wait, but in some languages like C, each block must be enclosed in braces if they contain multiple statements. So perhaps that's what was intended here.

So the problem is that after the first }, the code has an else which isn't part of any block because it didn't have braces around it. To fix this, I need to add braces for both branches.

Wait, but looking at the original code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

This ends with two closing braces: one after if and another after else. But in reality, that's incorrect because only the if block is closed by the first }, so the else statement comes next, which isn't part of any block.

So to fix this, perhaps I should add a brace around the else clause.

Wait no, actually, in many languages like C or JavaScript, you can have an else without braces if it's a single statement. So maybe that wasn't the issue. But since the error is about unexpected '}', perhaps the code is supposed to be written with multiple statements inside each block, hence needing braces for both.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But then why does the original code have an extra closing brace? Wait, no, in that case, it would be fixed by adding the second brace around else.

So perhaps the fix is to enclose both branches with braces:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, this might not solve the issue because the original code had two closing braces: one after if and another after else. So in reality, it's ending up as if the first } closes the if block, then there's an else statement that isn't part of any block, so when the next brace is encountered, perhaps that's causing the error.

Wait, maybe I should adjust the code to have braces around both branches:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each branch has its own braces. So in this case, after the first }, it correctly closes the if block, then the else is followed by { and }, which would fix the syntax.

But wait, the original code had an extra } at the end. Let me check:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that's two closing braces: one after if, another at the very end. So in reality, it would be:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2;

} 

Which is incorrect because after the first }, there's an else which isn't part of any block.

So perhaps the fix is to close the else with a brace and add one more at the end. Wait no, that doesn't make sense because in C-like syntax, else can be followed by a block or not.

Alternatively, maybe I need to ensure that all braces are properly closed.

Wait, perhaps the original code had an extra closing brace at the end, which is incorrect. So if I remove that and add one more after else:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each statement inside the blocks has braces, but it's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps in some languages like JavaScript, you can have single statements without braces. So maybe that wasn't necessary, but since the error is about an extra brace, adding braces around the else block would fix it.

So putting it all together, I think the correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each branch has its own block with braces, so there are no extra or missing braces causing syntax errors.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by having an unexpected closing brace after the else statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that both the if and else blocks have their respective opening and closing braces.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
- The original code closes the if block with `}`, but then an else statement follows without proper braces.
- Adding braces around both the assignment in the if block and the else statement fixes the syntax error by correctly enclosing each branch.

The corrected code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

```
