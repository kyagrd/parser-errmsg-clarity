Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem. The user mentioned an "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a missing or extra bracket somewhere.

Looking at the code provided: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Wait, there are two closing brackets here. The if block ends with ], then later another ]. That's probably causing an error because each bracket should be properly closed without extras.

So the original code has `[` and `]` around 'a=1' which is correct for a block statement, but then it ends with else followed by another ] which isn't needed. The else part shouldn't have its own ]. So I think the extra ] at the end is causing the issue.

I should remove that last closing bracket to fix the syntax. Let me check: without the last ], does the code make sense? Yes, because the if-else structure only needs one set of brackets for each block inside if and else.

So the corrected code would be `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;` without the trailing ]. That should resolve the error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
