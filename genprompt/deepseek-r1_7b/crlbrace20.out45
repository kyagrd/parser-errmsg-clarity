Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet provided: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice there's an error with the syntax here. The user mentioned that the problem is a "syntax error," so I need to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.

First, looking at the code structure. An if-else statement in most programming languages has two main parts: the condition, then the block for true, and optionally the block for false. The user's code seems to have both blocks present.

In the given code, after the if block { a = 1; }, there's an else followed by b = 2; but it ends with just a semicolon } without closing the else statement properly. So I think the issue is that the else block isn't enclosed within curly braces.

In many languages like C or JavaScript, each conditional statement should have its own curly braces for blocks. Without them, only the first statement after the if/else is considered part of the condition. Here, the else b = 2; is probably not indented correctly and might be causing a syntax error because it's attached to the if without braces.

So, I think adding an opening and closing curly brace around the else block would fix this. That way, both the true and false parts are properly enclosed within their own blocks.

Let me rewrite that part: instead of } else b = 2;, it should be } else { b = 2; }. Wait, actually, looking again, the code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So, the structure is if (...) { ... } else { ... }, but since there are no braces after else, it's just one line. So I should make sure to add braces around both parts.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the code as given has two separate blocks: a =1 inside {} and then else followed by b=2; without any braces for the else part. That would cause an error because the else isn't properly bound to anything except the condition x>0, which might not be intended.

So the fix is to make sure that both branches have their own braces. So I'll add an opening brace after else and close it before b=2;.

Wait no, actually, let me correct myself: The if statement starts with { at the beginning, then inside the block a=1;. Then outside of that block comes the else statement, followed by b=2; without any braces. But in most languages, this is invalid because after else, you need an opening brace to start the else block.

So the correct structure would be:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But looking at the original code, it's written as if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

The closing brace is misplaced. So perhaps the error is that there are two closing braces in a row: one after the if block and another at the end without being properly closed.

Wait no, looking again:

The code ends with } }, which would be an extra closing brace. Wait, let me check.

No, actually, the original code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that's: if block opens {, then inside it a=1;, then } to close if block, followed by else and b=2; without any braces for else. Then another ; after else statement, but the code is ending with an extra }, which would be incorrect.

Wait no, perhaps the original code has two closing braces: one at the end of the if block, and another at the very end, making a syntax error because it's expecting only three statements.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the else statement isn't properly enclosed in curly braces. So when you have an if-else without braces, each statement must be on its own line or within the same block. But here, the else b=2; is attached to the if without braces, which might cause a syntax error because it's not part of any block.

Therefore, I think adding braces around the else clause would fix the issue.
...done thinking.

The code has an `else` statement that isn't properly enclosed within curly braces. To fix this, we'll add braces around both the `if` and `else` blocks:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This ensures each condition is correctly associated with its corresponding block of code.

The fixed code inside backticks:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
