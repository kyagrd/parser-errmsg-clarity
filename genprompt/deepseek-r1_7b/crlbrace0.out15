Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it again. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I remember that in an if-else statement in JavaScript, both branches need to be properly enclosed within the curly braces. Right now, the structure seems off.

Looking closer, the if condition has its block: { a = 1; }, which is correct. But then there's an else followed by b=2; } but it's not inside any block after the else. So that's probably where the problem lies.

Wait, in JavaScript, each if statement must have braces around both the true and false cases. The code as written has only one brace at the end, which doesn't cover the else part. That would cause a syntax error because the else isn't properly connected to an opening brace.

So I need to add the missing curly braces. Let me think: after the if block, there should be another opening brace before the else statement so that both branches are enclosed within their own blocks. So it should look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each part of the if-else is properly scoped. The code now has two sets of braces: one around the true case and another around the else case.

I can double-check this by looking at how similar conditional statements are structured in JavaScript. Yes, both branches need their own curly braces after the keyword. So adding the extra brace before else should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error because it doesn't properly enclose the `else` statement within braces. Here's the fixed version:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue:** The original code has an `else` statement but doesn't enclose it within braces, leading to a syntax error.

2. **Add Missing Braces:** Both the `if` and `else` conditions must be enclosed in their own `{ }` blocks. This ensures each block is properly formed.

3. **Resulting Code:** The corrected code now has `{}` around both branches of the conditional statement, resolving the syntax issue.

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
