Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and some code. Let me see what's going on here.

The code given is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

And the error message says: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). Hmm, that sounds like there's an extra closing brace somewhere. 

Looking at the code, I see that the if statement is correctly opened with { and closed with }. Then, outside of that block, there's an else statement followed by b = 2; and another } which must be causing the issue.

Wait, so after the else clause, the code has a semicolon, then another }. That means the closing brace for the if statement is being used again after the else. But since the if block already closed before, this extra } is not needed. So that's why it's an error—it's an unexpected '}' because there's an extra one.

So I need to remove that last }, so the code doesn't try to close the if statement again where it's already done. Let me adjust that.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
