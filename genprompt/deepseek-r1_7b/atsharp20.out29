Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet with a syntax error, and I need to fix it. The user provided an error message which is just "syntax error," so I can't rely on any other information except what's in the code itself.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, first off, I see that there are two lines. The first line has an `if` statement with some operators and variables. The second line seems to be handling the else case.

Wait, in programming, indentation is important for readability, but does it affect syntax? In many languages like Python or C++, indentation defines code blocks, so if this is a language where that's not the case (like maybe JavaScript?), then the issue might be something else. But looking at the error message, it's just "syntax error," which suggests there's an issue with the structure of the code.

Looking closer, on the first line after `if`, there's an operator `@` followed by a variable assignment `a = 1;`. That doesn't look right. In many languages, operators like `@` are used for things like pointers in C or references in Ruby, but I don't think that's what's intended here.

Wait, maybe this is part of a ternary operator? Or perhaps the code uses JavaScript syntax where `a = 1;` inside an if condition isn't valid. Alternatively, it might be using C-like syntax, but even then, having `@a = 1` doesn't make sense in C.

Another thought: maybe the line continuation is an issue. The first line ends with a semicolon, so perhaps the code is trying to continue on the next line without proper line breaks or indentation. But if that's the case, it might not be the syntax error but rather formatting issues.

Wait, looking at the second line: `# else b = 2; #`. The `else` is indented and followed by an assignment. That doesn't look right either because in most languages, after an `if`, you have a block that's indented or uses braces for blocks. Using `else` without any corresponding opening brace could cause issues.

Putting it all together, the main issues seem to be:

1. The use of `@a = 1` which isn't valid syntax in most languages.
2. The presence of `else b = 2;` on a separate line with comments that might not be intended there.
3. Possible missing braces or incorrect block structure.

So, how can I fix this? Let's consider each part.

First, the line starting with `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;`. The `@a` doesn't make sense unless it's JavaScript and using an object literal with syntax like `@ {a: 1}`, but that would be written differently. Alternatively, perhaps it was intended to be `a = 1;` without the `@`.

Wait, maybe it's a typo and should just be `a = 1;`. So removing the `@` might fix it.

Then, looking at the second line: `else b = 2;`. In many languages, you can't have an `else` statement with just an assignment. You need to have a block or some code to execute, usually enclosed in braces `{}`. So perhaps the user intended to write:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But in their code, it's not using braces and is just on separate lines with comments.

So putting it all together, I can reformat the code to use proper syntax. The first line should be an if condition followed by code inside braces or a block. Similarly for else.

Also, considering that they used `@` and `#` which are not standard in many languages, maybe those were intended as comments but placed incorrectly.

So, I think the correct approach is to write it with proper indentation and braces, and fix the assignment without the `@`.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
