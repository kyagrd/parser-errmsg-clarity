Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "syntax error". Let me look at the code they gave:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see something wrong here. First, I notice that after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there's a square bracket [. In Python, square brackets are used for lists or dictionaries, but in an if-else statement, using them isn't correct.

So, probably, the user meant to write an else block inside the if condition. Let me think about how an if-else structure should look. It should be:

if (condition):
    do something
else:
    do something else

But looking at their code, after [ a = 1; ] there's an else b = 2; ]. Wait, but in Python, semicolons are used to separate statements on the same line, and each if-else block must be properly indented.

So maybe they intended to have two cases: one where x is greater than 0 and another where it's not. So I think they meant to write:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in their code, they used [ instead of the colon for if, which caused the syntax error.

Also, there are extra square brackets at the end ] else...]. Probably those should be removed because it's causing the structure to be incorrect.

So putting it all together, I'll fix the code by replacing the square brackets with colons and proper indentation. That way, each block under if and else will have their own indented lines.
...done thinking.

The original code has syntax errors due to improper use of square brackets instead of colons for conditional statements in Python. The correct structure uses colons followed by indented blocks.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
