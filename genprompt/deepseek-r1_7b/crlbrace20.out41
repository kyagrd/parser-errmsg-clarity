Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix a syntax error in this code snippet. Let me look at what's given.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

First, I notice that the if statement ends with `{ a = 1; }` and then there's an `else` block starting with `b=2;`. But looking at the code structure, it seems like the else is part of the if condition, which might not be intended. In many programming languages, each control structure (like if) can have only one compound statement inside its braces unless you use specific syntax to include multiple statements.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the issue isn't about multiple statements but about missing braces. Let me check: The first part is `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. So after the if block, there's an else statement followed by a closing brace at the end.

Wait, no—the code seems to have two closing braces. Let me count. The if has one opening brace `{` and then `}`, which is correct for its body. Then, the else part starts with `else b = 2;`, but it's not within braces. So when does this line close? It ends at the semicolon before the next `}`.

But looking at the code again, after `else b=2;` there's another `}`, which is the end of the if-else block. But in that case, the else statement doesn't have a body—it's just an expression, which isn't allowed because else must be followed by a block enclosed in braces.

So the problem is that the else is not inside any braces. To fix it, I should add `{ }` after `else`.

Let me rewrite that part: The code becomes:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That way, both the if and else have their own blocks properly enclosed in braces. This should fix the syntax error because each condition now has its own block with proper opening and closing braces.

I think that's it. So the fixed code is as above.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
