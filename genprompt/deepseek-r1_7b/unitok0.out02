Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at what's provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay, first off, I notice that the user mentioned using only the error message and not any pre-trained knowledge. So I should focus on the syntax issue without relying on my existing understanding.

The error message is "syntax error." That usually means there's something wrong with how the code is structured or written. Let me look at the code structure step by step.

Starting from the if statement: if (x > 0) ... else b = 2; 

Between the parentheses and the closing parenthesis, I see some text inside 《 and 》. It looks like they're using these symbols as brackets, maybe for a block of code? So it's something like:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

But in the given code, instead of curly braces {}, they're using these 《 and 》 symbols.

So the code is written as: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 

Wait, but there's an extra 》 at the end. Let me count them:

The opening bracket after 'if' has one 《, then inside that, they have a semicolon and another closing bracket 》. Then outside of that, they have another 》 after the else statement.

So it looks like this structure: 

if (x>0) 《 ... 》 else b=2; 》

That's three brackets in total: one opening 《, then a closing 》 inside the if block, and another 》 outside after the else. That might be causing an issue because each code block should start with { and end with }.

So maybe they intended to use curly braces but used these other symbols instead, which are not valid in that context. Alternatively, perhaps they were trying to write something else but messed up the syntax.

Looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I think the problem is that there's an extra closing bracket 》 after the else statement. So the structure becomes: 

- if block has one opening and one closing 》, but inside it, they have 'a=1;'
- Then outside, another 》 which doesn't have a matching opening.

So to fix this, I should replace those brackets with proper curly braces { } because in code blocks like if statements, we usually use curly braces. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write something else, but given that it's an if statement followed by an else and each block has one line of code, using proper braces makes sense.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each condition is properly enclosed within curly braces, which is standard in most programming languages. The extra brackets were causing a syntax error because they're not recognized as valid block terminators.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect bracket usage and an extraneous closing bracket after the else statement. By replacing the 《 and 》 with proper curly braces { }, we fix the syntax errors.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
