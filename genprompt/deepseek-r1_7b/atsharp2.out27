Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The user mentioned it's in an unusual language since the syntax is different from C, Java, Python, etc. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause, which suggests that too many comments are being used.

I notice the code has two lines with '#' at the end. In some languages, having multiple comment-like structures (like @ or #) in a single if statement can cause issues because each might be interpreted as separate statements or blocks.

The error message specifically points to the second '#', which is after 'else b = 2;'. It seems like this line is causing confusion with the else clause. Perhaps only one comment should be present, and the rest are actually part of the if statement structure.

Looking closer, maybe the first '#' after '@' is meant to end a block or an expression. The second '#' is indeed a syntax error because it's in the wrong place for another comment.

So, I think removing both '#'s would fix the issue. This leaves only one line with the else clause without any extra comments. Let me try that:

if (x > 0) @a =1; else b=2;

That way, there's only one block after the if statement, and no extra comments causing confusion.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @a =1; else b=2;
```
