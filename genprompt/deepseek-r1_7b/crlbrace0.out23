Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the error message is "syntax error," and they want me to fix it without using any pre-trained knowledge. That probably means I need to look at the code carefully and figure out where the problem is based on what's visible.

Looking at the code, it starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. Hmm, that looks a bit off. Let me break it down.

First, the condition `(x > 0)` seems correct on its own. Then there's `{ a = 1; }` which is an if block. The syntax here might be okay because in some languages you can have statements inside braces, like assigning `a=1`. But then comes the else part: `else b = 2;`.

Wait, I think the issue is with how the code is structured after the else statement. In many programming languages, when you have an if-else structure, both branches need to be properly enclosed within curly braces `{}`. So in this case, the else block should also be inside its own curly braces.

So the original code has `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. I notice that after the else statement, there's an extra closing brace at the end of the line. That might not be directly causing the syntax error because sometimes extra braces can go unnoticed, but it's better to check.

But actually, looking again, perhaps the problem is with how the else is connected. The code should have curly braces for both branches. So the correct structure would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }

Alternatively, if we want to combine them under one pair of braces, it should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, both the if and else statements have their own curly braces but are not properly closed. Wait no, actually, looking again: the first part is `{ a = 1; }` which ends with a brace, then `else b = 2;` without any braces, followed by another `}` at the end.

So that's two issues:

1. The else statement doesn't have its own opening curly brace.
2. There's an extra closing curly brace after the else statement, which might not be intended but still causes syntax errors because it's unbalanced.

To fix this, I need to add an opening curly brace after the else statement and ensure that all braces are properly closed in order.

So rewriting the code:

- Keep the if condition as is.
- The if block should have a closing brace, which it already does.
- Then the else statement needs its own opening brace `{`.
- After the else statement, add a closing brace `}` to match the initial one after the if block and any others.

Putting it all together:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, both branches of the if-else are properly enclosed within their own braces. This should eliminate the syntax error because the structure is now correct with balanced braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
