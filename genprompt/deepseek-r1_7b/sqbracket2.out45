Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to help fix this code based on the error message provided. The error is: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, okay, so there's an if-else statement here. Inside the if block, they have `(x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`. Wait, that doesn't look right. The brackets around 'a=1;' might be causing issues.

The error mentions an unexpected ']'. Let me count the brackets. The code starts with `if (x > 0) [`, so that's one [. Then inside, there's a semicolon and another ], which closes the if block. But then there's an else followed by another ; and a ] at the end.

So the structure is:

- if condition [ ... ]
- else ...

The problem might be that after the else, they have `]` again, but maybe it's not needed or misplaced.

Looking at how code usually works, each control structure like if should have its own matching brackets. Here, the if block ends with ], which closes the if statement. Then, the else is a separate clause. So having another ] after else might be incorrect because it would close something that isn't there yet.

So perhaps the extra ] at the end of the code is causing the error. Let me check: 

The code has `if (...) [ ... ] else b = 2; ]`. The if block ends with ], then else, which doesn't need a bracket since it's part of the same control structure. But then another ] follows, which might be closing something incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the initial approach is wrong. In some languages, like JavaScript or similar, you can have the code inside an array using square brackets. So perhaps `(x > 0) [ ... ]` is intended to mean that when x>0, a=1; else b=2. But in this case, the structure isn't correct because of the extra ].

So maybe the error is due to having two closing brackets: one for the if and another after the else, which doesn't belong there.

I think the solution is to remove that extra ]. So the code should be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

That way, each part closes properly without any unmatched brackets.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because of an extra closing bracket `]` after the else clause. Removing this will fix the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
