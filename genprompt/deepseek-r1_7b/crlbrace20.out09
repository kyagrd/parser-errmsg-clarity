Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, there are two issues here. First, the closing brace for the if statement seems off. The if block starts with '{' and then has an else statement without any condition bracket. Wait, actually, no—the code is written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

So the structure is: if condition { statement } else statement. That's not valid syntax because in most languages like C or Java, you need an else block with its own braces.

Wait, maybe it's using JavaScript? But in JS, you can't have an else without a block. Alternatively, perhaps the code is meant for a different language where else can be followed by a single statement without braces, but that's unusual.

Alternatively, looking at the error message: syntax error. So there are two main issues:

1. The else statement is outside the if block because it lacks braces.
2. There's an extra closing brace at the end which doesn't match any opening brace.

Wait, let me count the braces:

The code has:
if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

So after the if block closes with }, then 'else' starts but without braces, so that's invalid. Then another } at the end which doesn't match any opening brace.

Wait no, the original code ends with '} else b = 2; }'—so actually, the structure is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

So after 'a=1;', there's a }, then 'else', which should be part of an if statement. So perhaps it's meant to have another condition, but that's not present.

Wait, maybe the code was written as:

if (x>0) { a = 1; } else b =2;

But in JavaScript or other languages, you can't write 'else' on its own like that without an if block. So perhaps the correct structure is to have another condition with else if.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } elseif (x<=0) { b=2; }

So let me restructure the code accordingly.

Also, looking at the original code, after the if block closes, there's an 'else' and then another statement without braces. So adding else if would fix that by combining with the existing condition.

Wait no, because in the original code, it's just else b=2; which is not valid syntax unless you're using a language where else can follow without an if block, but I don't think that's standard.

So perhaps the correct approach is to wrap both conditions inside the same if-else if structure.

Let me try rewriting the code:

if (x > 0) {
    a =1;
} else if (some other condition) {
    b=2;
}

But wait, in the original code, after the first }, there's an 'else' which is not part of any block. So adding an else if would require another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code intended to have only one statement and just place else outside, but that's invalid syntax because else must be attached to an if.

So, combining all this, the main issues are:

1. The 'else' is placed without being part of an if block.
2. The extra closing brace at the end which doesn't match any opening brace.
3. Possibly incorrect use of else in a way that's not standard syntax.

To fix it, I'll restructure it into a proper if-else structure with correct braces and conditions.
...done thinking.

The code has issues with improper placement of `else` and mismatched braces. The corrected code structures the statements properly within an if-else block.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else if (x <= 0) { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The original `else` was outside the initial `if` block, causing syntax errors.
2. Added `else if` to properly encapsulate subsequent conditions and maintain correct brace placement.
3. Combined both statements into a single if-else structure for syntactic correctness.

The final code ensures that each statement is correctly associated with its respective condition within an if-else framework.
