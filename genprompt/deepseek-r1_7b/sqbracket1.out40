Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like there's a mismatched bracket somewhere.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Wait, I see square brackets here. The error message mentions an unexpected ']', which suggests that there's an extra closing bracket or maybe it's placed incorrectly.

Let me break it down. The if statement is written as `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Oh, right! The code starts with an if condition in parentheses, which is correct. Then there are square brackets around `a = 1;` and another square bracket after the else clause.

Wait, I think the problem is that the user used square brackets for what should be braces or parentheses. In JavaScript, you use curly braces `{}` for code blocks inside conditions. So using square brackets here is causing issues because they're not expected there.

So, in the original code, `(x > 0)[ a = 1; ]` might have been intended as an array access if it were square brackets without being part of a condition. But since it's within an if statement, those square brackets are probably incorrect and should be replaced with curly braces `{}`.

Let me try rewriting the code:

Change `[a = 1;]` to `{a = 1;}`, so the entire if block uses correct syntax. Then, after the else clause, there was a closing `];`, which is causing an extra ] because the last part is another ] instead of just `}`.

So putting it all together, I'll replace the square brackets with curly braces and remove the extra ] at the end.

The corrected code should look like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in the user's original code, after `else`, there was a semicolon followed by another ]. So perhaps they meant to have an else statement with its own block. But since they didn't use braces before, maybe it's better to just fix the brackets.

Alternatively, if using square brackets without proper syntax is intentional (like in shorthand object literals or something), but that doesn't seem to fit here.

I think replacing the square brackets with curly braces and removing the trailing ] should fix the error. Let me check again:

Original code ends with `else b = 2; ]`. After fixing, it should end with `else b = 2;` without the extra ]. So yes, that's correct.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
