Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this code based on the given error message and instructions. The user provided a code snippet with an error: syntax error. Here's the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

First, I'll look at the structure of the if-else statement to spot any obvious issues.

I notice that there are two closing braces `}` after the else block. In most programming languages, each control structure like if-else should have only one corresponding brace. So having an extra brace is probably causing a syntax error because it's not properly closed.

Looking closer:
- The main if statement starts with `{`, and inside it has `a = 1;`.
- Then the else clause starts with `{` again, which is unnecessary because the main block already covers that condition.
- After the else clause ends with `}`, there's another `}` at the end of the code.

So I think the problem is having two closing braces. The correct structure should have only one brace for the if statement and one for the else clause, but in this case, it seems like the else block doesn't need a separate brace because it's just a single line.

Wait, actually, no—if-else statements usually don't require extra braces when each condition has its own code. So perhaps the error is that there are two closing braces at the end of the code. Let me check:

The original code ends with `}` after else b = 2; and then another `}` outside. That's incorrect because only one brace should close the if statement.

So I'll remove the extra brace. The corrected code should have only one opening brace after if, one closing brace at the end of the if-else block, and no additional braces.

Let me rewrite it:

The correct code would be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, there's only one `}` after else, which properly closes the if statement. The extra brace at the end was causing the syntax error because it wasn't needed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
