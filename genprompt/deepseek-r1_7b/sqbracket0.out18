Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and the original code snippet. My task is to correct the code based solely on the error message without using any pre-existing knowledge beyond that.

First, let me read the given code carefully:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I notice that there's an `if` statement here. The structure seems to be incomplete because after the `else`, there's another bracket `[` which doesn't look right in this context. In programming languages like C or Java, square brackets are used for array indexing or accessing methods. But here, they're inside an `if` condition, which isn't correct.

Looking at the code again, I see that after the `else`, there's a `[ ]`. That must be causing the syntax error because it's not properly closed. In most languages, square brackets are used for specific purposes and shouldn't appear where control structures like `if` or `else` end statements.

So, maybe the user intended to use curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets `[ ]` to enclose the block of code inside the `if` statement. Curly braces are standard in many programming languages to denote blocks of code that should be executed together under a condition.

Let me try rewriting the code with the correct syntax:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

I removed the square brackets and added curly braces for both the `if` and `else` blocks. This should fix the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed, and the code makes sense.

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript or C, sometimes they use different notations. However, since the user didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a general case where curly braces are appropriate for function bodies within control structures.

I should also check if there's anything else wrong with this code. The statements `a = 1;` and `b = 2;` inside their respective blocks seem fine as they stand. There's no obvious logical error, just the syntax issue that was causing the problem.

So, putting it all together, replacing the square brackets with curly braces in both places should fix the syntax error without changing the intended functionality of the code.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
