Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Looking at this, I notice that after the else statement, there's an unmatched semicolon before closing the if block. In programming languages like C or Java, each control structure must be properly closed with braces on both ends.

Wait, actually, looking closer, the code has two if-else blocks? Or is it a single if statement with two conditions? No, it seems to have only one condition inside the if block and then an else without any if. So perhaps the issue is that after the else, there's no corresponding opening brace.

Wait, let me parse this again. The code starts with if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }. Oh, right! After the else statement, it ends with a semicolon before the closing brace of the if block. That means that after the else clause, which is written without an opening brace, but then followed by a semicolon and another closing brace.

So in many languages, this would be invalid because each control structure must have braces on both sides. So the code has an extra closing brace at the end, or perhaps it's missing some braces.

Wait, looking again: the code is written as if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }. That ends with two semicolons and then another closing brace which doesn't match. So I think the issue is that after the else statement, there should be an opening brace before it's closed.

So the structure should be:

if (x>0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, the else is followed by b=2; and then another }, which would make the second } belong to the if statement. But since there's no opening brace for the else part, it's invalid.

So I need to add an opening brace after else to properly close both blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps the else should be followed by a block enclosed in braces.

Wait, let me count the braces:

In the original code: { } is opened inside if, then after else, another }, which would match with the initial one. But since there's no opening brace for else, it's invalid.

So to fix this, I need to add an opening brace right after else so that both if and else have their own blocks.

Therefore, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Yes, that makes sense. So adding the braces around each statement inside the if-else block will fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has an extra closing brace and is missing braces for the else clause. By adding braces after the else keyword, both clauses are properly enclosed.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The fixed code: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The syntax error was caused by an extra closing brace without matching opening braces for the else clause.
2. Add an opening brace after the else keyword to properly close both clauses within their respective blocks.

Answer: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
