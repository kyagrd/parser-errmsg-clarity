Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's supposed to be fixed, and the error message is saying there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, it looks like the user provided some code in triple backticks. The original code ends with } else b=2; }, which means there's an extra closing brace at the end. That must be causing the syntax error because after the else clause, another } is present incorrectly.

Wait, let me parse the code step by step. The if statement starts with (x > 0) { and then inside, a =1;. Then it has } else b=2; }. So, after the else part, there's another }, which isn't needed because the if-else structure only needs two braces: one opening for the entire condition and one closing at the end of the last statement.

So the code should probably remove that extra closing brace. Let me write it out:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, this way, there's only one }, which closes the if block after both statements inside are done.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there's an extra closing curly brace at the end of the code. This happens when the braces for the conditional statement aren't balanced correctly.

The fixed code removes the extra closing brace to match the opening brace properly:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Output:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
