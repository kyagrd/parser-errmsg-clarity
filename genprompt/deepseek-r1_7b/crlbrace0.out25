Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

```fixme
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, first off, I notice that there's an extra closing brace at the end of the if-else statement. That should definitely cause a syntax error because it doesn't match properly with the opening brace.

Let me break down the code structure. The original code is supposed to check if x is greater than 0. If true, assign a = 1; else, assign b = 2. But looking at how it's written, after the else statement, there's only one closing brace. That means the else block isn't closed correctly.

Wait, in the current code, it's written as `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. So, the if condition is correct with its opening and closing braces, but the else statement doesn't have its own block. In most programming languages like JavaScript or Python, each conditional keyword (like if, else) should be followed by an indented block.

So, to fix this, I need to add a { after the else statement so that it correctly closes its block. Let me visualize how that would look:

The corrected code should be:
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}

But wait, looking back at the user's code, they have only one closing brace after the else statement, which is causing the error. So I just need to add another { right after else and then close it with an additional }.

Putting it all together, the fixed code should have two separate blocks for if and else, each enclosed properly within their own braces. That means adding { after else and making sure there's a corresponding closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The original code has mismatched curly braces due to an extra closing brace. We need to add a new opening brace right after `else` and ensure all braces are properly closed.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue**: The code ends with an extra closing brace, which doesn't match any preceding block.
2. **Correct the Structure**: Add an opening brace `{` immediately after `else`.
3. **Close the Else Block**: Add a corresponding closing brace `}` for the else statement.

The fixed code is:

```fixme
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
}
else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```

**Fixed Code:**
```fixme
if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1; 
}
else { 
    b = 2; 
}
```
