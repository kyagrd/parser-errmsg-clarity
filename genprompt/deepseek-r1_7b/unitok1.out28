Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Let me look at the code again.

The original code is:
```javascript
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I notice the lines are indented differently. The if statement starts with some spaces and then has an 'else' clause on the same line but indented more. That might be causing issues.

Wait, looking at the characters after if: there's a closing angle bracket or something? The code uses 《 which seems like a Unicode character for a full-width right angle bracket. Maybe it's not recognized correctly in JavaScript.

Also, the else is followed by '》', another full-width bracket. But where are these going? It looks like they're placed incorrectly because after the if block, there should be an opening and closing brace.

So perhaps instead of 《 and 》 around a=1, it's supposed to use regular parentheses or brackets correctly. Also, the else statement might need proper braces.

Let me try breaking it down:

The original code has:
if (x > 0) 《a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I think the main issues are the misplaced 《 and 》 around 'a=1' and the extra 》 after else. It seems like these angle brackets are causing syntax errors because JavaScript isn't expecting them there.

So, to fix this, I should probably remove those full-width brackets and use regular ones or braces as appropriate. Let's see:

If we change it to standard parentheses, but wait, in an if statement without braces, the code is fine. But since after else, another 》 is present, maybe using braces would be better.

So perhaps rewriting the code with proper structure:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each condition has its own block with opening and closing braces. This should fix the unexpected character error because we're replacing the wrong brackets with correct ones.

Alternatively, if parentheses were intended for some part, but in this context, it's not necessary. So using regular braces seems better to avoid confusion.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
