Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, there's an if statement here. The condition is x > 0, which makes sense. Then inside the bracket, it's trying to do something like a = 1;. But wait, in an if statement, you usually have an indented block for when the condition is true. Here, after the if, there's a square bracket instead of curly braces or parentheses.

Wait, I'm seeing [ and ] around 'a=1;'. That's unusual because in Python, we use curly braces {}, but maybe this code isn't meant to be Python. Or perhaps it's using another syntax where brackets are used for something else.

Looking at the error message: syntax error. So there's definitely a problem with how the brackets are used here.

In an if statement in many programming languages, you have the condition followed by braces for the block. Here, instead of braces, they're using square brackets and then another bracket outside as well. That might be causing confusion.

So the code seems to try to write something like:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

But that's not correct because after if, you need either {} or [] depending on what it is supposed to do. But even then, having two brackets doesn't make sense.

Wait, looking closer, the code has 'if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]' with an extra closing bracket at the end. So after the else statement, there's another ], which probably closes something incorrectly.

So perhaps the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in the given code, they have [ ] around each block instead of curly braces and an extra bracket at the end. So I need to change those square brackets into either nothing or just one set.

Wait, but if you remove both sets of brackets, it might work because Python doesn't require them for single statements on separate lines. Alternatively, maybe they were trying to use a different syntax where blocks are denoted by [], but that's not standard in Python.

So the main issues here are:
1. Using square brackets instead of curly braces or nothing.
2. Having an extra closing bracket at the end which isn't needed.

Let me try removing the square brackets and see if that fixes it. So replacing [ ] with just {} would make sense, but actually, in Python, you can write:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

So without any braces because each block is on its own line.

Alternatively, maybe the code was intended for another language where square brackets are used, but regardless, removing both sets of brackets should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has mismatched and extra square brackets. By replacing them with nothing (or using proper indentation), we fix the syntax errors.

```python
if (x > 0)  a = 1
else        b = 2
```

Wait, actually, in Python, each block should be properly indented. So perhaps better to write:

```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

But following the original structure with colons and indentation, the fixed code is:

if (x>0)a=1; else b=2;

So putting it all together inside triple backticks as per instructions.

```python
if (x > 0)a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But maybe better to remove unnecessary braces and semicolons. So the most concise fixed code is:

```python
if(x>0):a=1
else:b=2
```
