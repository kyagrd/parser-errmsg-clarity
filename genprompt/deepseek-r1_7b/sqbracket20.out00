Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix a syntax error in this code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and then some code that looks like it might be from a different language, probably something like C or Java because of the if statement structure. 

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Hmm, I notice that inside the if condition, there's an array syntax being used with square brackets `[ ]`. But in many languages like C or Java, when you have an if statement, you can't just open and close an array. That might be part of the problem.

Also, after the else statement, there's another closing bracket `]` which doesn't seem to match anything. So maybe that extra bracket is causing a syntax error because it's not properly closed or matched.

Let me break it down. The code inside the if condition has `[ a = 1; ]`, but in languages like C, this would be trying to treat an array as an expression which isn't valid unless it's part of an array declaration or access. But here, it's placed inside an if statement without being an array declaration. That doesn't make sense because you can't have an array initializer in a condition like that.

So perhaps the correct approach is to remove those square brackets and just write it as a normal assignment within the if block. That would fix the syntax error because we're no longer using incorrect bracket usage.

Putting it all together, I'll rewrite the code by removing the unnecessary `[ ]` around `a = 1` and also close the else statement properly without an extra closing bracket. The corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
This way, the if-else structure is correct, assignments are inside their respective blocks, and there's no mismatched or unnecessary brackets causing syntax issues.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by mismatched square brackets. The code incorrectly uses `[ ]` around an assignment in the `if` block and has an extra closing bracket.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Remove the square brackets `[ ]` around `a = 1`.
2. Ensure proper indentation for readability.
3. Correctly close the else statement without an extra closing bracket.

The fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
