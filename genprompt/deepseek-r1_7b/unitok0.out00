Thinking...
Alright, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message and the original code. Let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

First, the error is "syntax error." That usually means there's something wrong with how the code is structured or written. Now, looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I see that the if statement has braces { and }, which are used in JavaScript for object literals. But here, they're placed inside the if condition parentheses instead of enclosing the code block.

So, the issue is probably with how the braces are being used. In JavaScript, when defining an object literal, you use {}, but in this case, it's inside an if statement, which expects a single expression or a block enclosed by { and }.

Wait, actually, in JavaScript, for control structures like if statements, you can't just put { and } without something between them. So the code is trying to write an object literal where it shouldn't be. The correct approach would be to replace those 《 and 》 with regular braces { and }, but also make sure that the entire condition is properly structured.

Looking again, the original code has "if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》". It seems like it's trying to write an if-else statement where only one of the branches should be inside the object literal. So the braces { and } are misplaced.

I think the correct way is to have the code block under if enclosed properly. Let me break it down:

The corrected code should probably look like this:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But in the original code, they used 《 and 》 which are likely being used to represent object literals. Since that's not appropriate here, replacing them with { and } makes more sense.

So the main issue is using the wrong type of braces for the if statement. Instead of using object literal braces, use block braces { }. That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
