Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this code that has a syntax error. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, looking at the error message, it's just "syntax error." So something's wrong with the structure of the if statement.

First, I notice that there are two closing quotes after the else clause. The code has 《 and then another 》 after else, and then a final 》 after that. Maybe these brackets are causing an issue because they're not matching correctly.

In the original code, it seems like the developer tried to use some kind of syntax with angle brackets or something similar. But in standard programming languages, we don't use 《 and 》 for if statements. So perhaps those should be replaced with regular parentheses or square brackets depending on what's intended.

Wait, looking at how the code is written, maybe it's using HTML-like syntax because there are three backticks. Oh, I see! The code is inside triple backticks which usually means embedding a block of text within them, but here it's also defining some kind of code block with indentation. However, that might not be necessary for fixing the syntax error.

So focusing on the if statement: the structure should be:

if (condition):
    # code when condition is true
else:
    # code when condition is false

In the original code, after else, there's a closing quote and then another quote. So perhaps it's trying to close two brackets at once, which isn't correct.

Let me try removing the extra quotes. The first part: if (x>0) 《a=1;》... Maybe the angle brackets are incorrect here. Instead of using 《 and 》, maybe they should use parentheses or regular brackets since that's what control structures typically use in many languages.

So perhaps changing those to () would fix it. Let me see:

if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else ( b = 2; )

Wait, but using just parentheses around the assignments might not make sense because each assignment is on its own line with semicolons. Maybe they should be within the if and else blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a different syntax altogether where the entire block is enclosed in angle brackets or some other symbols. But that's unclear. Since I can only use symbols from the error message or standard syntax, maybe it's safer to replace the 《 and 》 with parentheses.

So putting it all together, replacing the 《 with ( and 》 with ), and removing any extra closing quotes:

if (x > 0) (a = 1; ) else (b = 2; )

Wait, but that still has an extra quote at the end. Let me check again. The original code ends with two quotes: after else there's one, and then another after the semicolon in the else block.

So perhaps I need to remove all those extra quotes. So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but that uses curly braces which are also valid for code blocks, especially when using triple backticks. But maybe in this case, it's better to use parentheses or other structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to remove all quotes and just have:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

But that might be too simplified depending on the intended language.

Wait, looking at the original code again: 《a = 1;》 after if condition. That seems like an attempt to group the assignment with parentheses or angle brackets, but they're not matching. So maybe using regular parentheses would fix it.

So perhaps:

if (x >0) ( a=1; ) else ( b=2; )

But that's still a bit unclear. Alternatively, if the code is in JavaScript, for example, the correct way would be to use curly braces inside the if-else block.

Wait, but without knowing the exact language, it's tricky. However, since I can only use symbols from standard syntax and the error message suggests using quotes or brackets, perhaps replacing 《 with ( and 》 with ).

So final code:

if (x>0) (a=1; ) else (b=2; )

But that might still have issues because assignments in an if-else block are usually on separate lines. Alternatively, maybe the braces should be used.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Remove all 《 and 》 as they are not needed.
2. Replace with proper parentheses or brackets depending on the context.
3. Ensure each statement inside if and else is properly enclosed.

But without knowing the exact language, it's hard. However, in many cases, using regular parentheses for expressions within conditions is acceptable.

So I'll try to rewrite the code as:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

That removes all quotes and uses semicolons correctly. But if that doesn't work, perhaps adding braces would be better.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to use curly braces for block statements.

So final answer: Replace 《 with { and 》 with }, but I think in this context, using parentheses might suffice.

Wait, another thought: The original code uses two closing quotes after else. So if we just remove those extra quotes, it should fix the syntax error.

So step by step:

Original code:
if (x>0) 《 a =1;》 else b=2; 》

First part: if condition is correct.

Then after if's closing parenthesis, there are two brackets. Let me count them: one 《 and then in between, some code, then one 》. Then another 》 at the end.

So perhaps it's meant to be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But without knowing the exact syntax, maybe using parentheses is better.

Wait, but in Python, for example, we use indentation and colons, so maybe that's not applicable here. But assuming this is JavaScript or similar, perhaps using curly braces would be correct.

Alternatively, if it's a different language like PHP, then curly braces aren't used; instead, you have to declare the code blocks with opening and closing tags.

But given that I can only use symbols from the error message (brackets and quotes), maybe just adjusting those is enough.

So perhaps:

if (x>0) 《a=1;》 else b=2;

Wait, but then after else, there's a semicolon. So actually, it's better to have each statement properly ended with semicolons or curly braces.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The main issue is the extra quotes at the end of else and the missing opening quote somewhere. So by removing those extra quotes and using regular parentheses, perhaps:

if (x>0) 《a=1;》else b=2;

But wait, in some languages like C or Java, you don't use angle brackets for conditionals. So maybe that's incorrect.

Alternatively, just remove the angle brackets entirely because they're not needed in standard if statements.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

That removes all quotes and uses semicolons correctly. Each assignment is on its own line with a semicolon.
...done thinking.

if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}

Wait, actually, using curly braces within the triple backticks makes sense if we're defining an embedded code block.

But perhaps it's better to just use parentheses for assignments. However, in many programming languages, you can't have multiple statements on one line without proper indentation or semicolons.

Alternatively, maybe each assignment should be properly terminated with a semicolon and indented under the respective if/else clause.

So another approach is:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But that uses curly braces which are valid in some contexts. However, considering triple backticks as code blocks, perhaps using parentheses isn't standard.

Wait, the original code has angle brackets or something similar because of the triple backticks. So maybe they were trying to create a custom syntax within the block.

Alternatively, since I can only use symbols from the error message (quotes and brackets), perhaps replacing them with parentheses would fix it.

So final answer:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

But that's not correct in terms of code structure because you can't have two statements on one line without proper semicolons and indentation.

Wait, maybe the original code was using angle brackets as a custom way to denote if-else blocks. So perhaps it should be:

if (x>0) 《a=1;》 else 《b=2;》

But that might not work either because each block would have its own set of quotes.

I think I need to adjust the code by removing all the extra quotes and just using parentheses or braces as appropriate. However, without knowing the exact language, it's hard to be precise. But based on standard syntax, replacing 《 with ( and 》 with ) seems reasonable.

So:

if (x>0) (a=1;) else (b=2;)

But that would make it a single statement which isn't valid because if-else requires two separate blocks. So perhaps adding curly braces inside the triple backticks is better.

Thus, the corrected code should be within triple backticks with proper indentation and using curly braces for block statements:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But I'm not entirely sure if that's necessary. However, given the constraints, this seems like the best approach.

Final answer:
if (x > 0) {a = 1;} else {b = 2;}

But to ensure proper syntax within triple backticks, maybe:

if (x>0)
{a=1;}
else
{b=2;}

Yes, that makes sense. So inside the triple backticks, each if-else block is properly enclosed with curly braces.

So final code:
``` 
if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}
```

But wait, without knowing the exact language, using curly braces might not be appropriate in all cases. However, since I can only use symbols from the error message and standard syntax, this seems acceptable.

Final answer:

if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}

Wait, but that's missing semicolons at the end of each block. So perhaps:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Yes, adding semicolons to close each statement.

So inside triple backticks, it would look like:
```
if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}
```

Thus, the fixed code is:

``` 
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But perhaps in this context, it's better to use parentheses if possible. However, since assignments can't be on separate lines without proper indentation or semicolons, maybe the correct approach is:

``` 
if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;
```

But that would cause a syntax error because of the lack of braces for block statements.

So perhaps it's better to go with using curly braces within the code block.

Final decision:
Replace all quotes and use proper parentheses or braces as necessary. Given the constraints, I'll use curly braces.
</think>

The original code has extra quotes that are causing a syntax error. By removing these quotes and properly enclosing each if-else block with curly braces (which is common in many programming languages), we can fix the issue.

```fix
if (x > 0) {a = 1; } else {b = 2;}
```

The fixed code removes the extraneous quotes and uses curly braces to correctly define the scope of each assignment within their respective if-else blocks.
