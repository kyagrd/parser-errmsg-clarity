Thinking...
Alright, so I have this code here with a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there are two separate lines starting with if and else. That's not right because in most programming languages, you have an if statement followed by an else clause on the same line or within a block.

Wait, looking closer, after the if condition, there's an @ symbol before 'a = 1'. I'm not sure what that does here. Maybe it's trying to use some operator or keyword incorrectly. But more importantly, the code has these comments starting with #. In many languages like C or Python, comments start with # and shouldn't be used for code continuation.

Oh right! The error message says there's a syntax error. So probably the @ is causing an issue because it's not recognized as a keyword in this context. Also, having two separate statements on different lines might not be valid unless each line is part of the same statement, which doesn't make sense here.

I think the intention was to have one if-else block with proper syntax. So maybe removing the @ and combining everything into one line would fix it. Let me try that:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

That way, both conditions are part of the same if statement without any comments in between. This should eliminate the syntax error because the code is now correctly structured as an if-else block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x>0)a=1; else b=2;
```
