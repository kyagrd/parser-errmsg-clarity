Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error message is "syntax error" and provided the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

First, I'll look at the structure of the code. It seems like there's an if-else statement here. In most programming languages, each control structure needs to be properly closed with its respective brace or parenthesis.

Looking closely at the lines after 'if (x > 0) { a = 1; }', there's an 'else' keyword followed by 'b = 2;' and then another closing brace that seems out of place. I think this might be causing the syntax error because in an if-else statement, each block should be enclosed within its own braces.

So, breaking it down:

The code starts with 'if (x > 0) { a = 1; }' which looks correct—closing brace after the if condition and the assignment. Then comes '} else b = 2; }. Hmm, here's where I think the problem is. The 'else' should be followed by another block enclosed in braces.

In many languages like JavaScript or Java, each else clause must have its own opening and closing braces. So instead of having just the else statement without braces, it should probably be something like '} else { b = 2; }'.

But wait, looking again at the code: 'else' is followed by a semicolon because the user wrote 'else b = 2; }'. That's incorrect syntax because you can't put an assignment after else. The correct way is to have an else block with braces.

So I think the fix involves changing the else statement to include its own braces and moving the closing brace up appropriately. Let me sketch it out:

Original code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Proposed correction:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each if and else block is properly enclosed within braces. Now, let me check the number of braces to make sure they're balanced.

The initial code had one opening brace after 'if', then an else followed by another opening brace (which was missing in my mind) but in the user's code, it wasn't there—so I need to add that. But looking at the user's provided code, actually, their code ends with a semicolon and a closing brace outside the else statement.

Wait, perhaps the user had:

if (...) { ... } else b = 2; }

Which is missing an opening brace after else. So adding that would fix it.

So putting it all together, I think the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
...done thinking.

The original code has two issues: the `else` statement is missing its opening brace and there's an extra closing brace. The fixed version properly closes each block with braces.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The corrected code:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The `else` statement was not followed by an opening brace `{`.
2. There was an extra closing brace `}` at the end, which now correctly closes the `else` block.
3. Both if and else blocks are properly enclosed with braces to maintain correct syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
