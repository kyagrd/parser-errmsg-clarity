Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax issue and shared some code. My task is to fix it based only on the error message they gave, without using any pre-existing knowledge beyond what's in the message. 

Let me look at the code they provided:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I notice that there are some unusual characters here: `@` and `#`. In typical if-else statements, we don't use these. So maybe those lines aren't part of the condition.

Wait, in programming, sometimes you see ternary operators like `(condition) ? true_val : false_val;`. But here, I have an `if` statement followed by some expressions with `@` and `#`. Maybe it's trying to combine multiple statements on the same line?

The code starts with `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

I think the problem is that these lines are not part of an if-else block. The `@` and `#` might be causing issues because they're not valid syntax in standard C or similar languages.

So, perhaps each line should be standalone statements after the if condition. Maybe I need to split them into separate lines for clarity.

Wait, but why are there two `;` at the end? That's redundant. So maybe removing that will fix it.

Putting this together, the corrected code should have separate lines for each conditional statement without the extraneous operators and semicolons.
...done thinking.

The original code has syntax errors because the statements after `if (x > 0)` are not properly structured as a valid if-else condition. The `@` operator is not recognized in this context, and the `#` symbols at the end of lines introduce more issues.

Here's the step-by-step solution:
1. Remove the `@` and `#` symbols.
2. Ensure each statement after `if (x > 0)` is on a new line to avoid syntax errors.
3. Remove any redundant or misplaced semicolons.
4. Structure the if-else statements correctly.

The corrected code should be:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if (x > 0)
        a = 1;
    else
        b = 2;
}
```

This version follows proper syntax by placing each statement on its own line and using standard if-else constructs.
