Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me look at it closely. The code is written in some programming language, maybe JavaScript or Python since those are common and use semicolons often.

The code given is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I notice that inside the if condition's parentheses, there's an opening bracket [. Then it has a semicolon ;. After the bracket, there's an else statement with another semicolon and then a closing ].

Wait, in JavaScript or similar languages, you use brackets for arrays or objects when declaring something like an object literal. But here, inside an if condition? That doesn't make sense. Also, after the bracket, it closes with ], which might be trying to close the if block but is misplaced.

So looking at the structure:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

The brackets are not needed here. The code inside the if condition should just have the statement(s). So instead of wrapping it in [], I think they were trying to put the assignment but used the wrong syntax.

So the correct code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, actually, in some languages like C or JavaScript, you don't need the curly braces for single statements. But here, the original code uses semicolons correctly except for the misplaced brackets.

So removing the brackets and adjusting the structure should fix it. Let me rewrite it without the unnecessary [ ].
...done thinking.

The syntax error was caused by using square brackets where they weren't needed inside an if condition. The correct code removes these brackets to adhere to JavaScript's syntax rules.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
