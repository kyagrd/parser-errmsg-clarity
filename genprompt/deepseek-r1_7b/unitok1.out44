Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the problem step by step.

The user provided the error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that means somewhere there's a character that Python doesn't recognize as part of the syntax, specifically after an else clause.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I can see that the user is using '《' and '》' instead of regular parentheses. In Python, we use normal round brackets for conditionals, so maybe those characters are causing issues.

The code starts with `if (x > 0)`, which is correct. Then it has `《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`. It looks like the user intended to write `( )` around the if statement and then an else block.

Wait, actually, in Python, after an if-else structure, you don't need parentheses unless it's part of a larger expression. Here, they might have meant to enclose the condition correctly.

So, probably, instead of using '《' and '》', which are Unicode characters for left and right brackets, respectively, the code should use regular parentheses `()`. Let me check if that makes sense.

Let me rewrite the code:

Replace `《` with `(` and `》` with `)`. So, the line becomes:

if (x > 0) (a = 1; ) else (b = 2);

Wait, but then I have extra parentheses. Let me adjust it properly. The original structure is an if-else statement, so each block should be within its own parentheses.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in the user's code, they have semicolons and multiple statements on each line. So I need to make sure that each statement is properly indented and within its respective block.

Putting it all together with proper indentation:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Yes, that should fix the syntax error because now the else clause correctly closes after its block without any extra or incorrect characters.
...done thinking.

The code contains syntax errors due to the use of '《' and '》' instead of regular parentheses. Additionally, there are misplaced semicolons and lack of proper indentation.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

The changes made include:
- Replacing '《' with '(' to open the condition.
- Replacing '》' with ')' to close the condition properly.
- Adding proper indentation for readability.
- Ensuring each statement is within its respective code block.
