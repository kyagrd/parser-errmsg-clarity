Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this code with a syntax error. Let me look at what's given.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

First, the error message says there's a syntax error. I remember that in programming, parentheses and brackets are crucial. Let me check each part.

Looking at the if statement: `if (x > 0)` seems fine. Then there's this block inside with 《 a = 1; 》. Hmm, those symbols aren't valid in most languages. Maybe they should be regular parentheses or curly braces?

Wait, in some languages like JavaScript, you can use curly braces for blocks. So perhaps the code is meant to have an if-else structure using curly braces.

So let me think about how that would look. The if block should probably have `{` instead of 《, and the else block as well. Let me rewrite that part: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`.

But then there's an extra closing brace at the end: `》`. That doesn't make sense because after the else block, we shouldn't have another brace. So maybe the code was supposed to be:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

So putting it all together without any special symbols like 《 or 》.

Let me count the braces: The if statement opens with {, then inside is a=1;, and closes with }. Then else should open another {. But in the original code, after else, there's another brace. That might be causing an extra brace at the end.

So I think replacing those symbols with regular curly braces would fix it. Let me write that out:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Yes, that looks correct. The parentheses are already there in the if condition, so no changes needed there. Also, removing the special symbols and using curly braces should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect block delimiters (《》) which are not recognized in most languages. Replacing them with regular curly braces {} fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
