Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause. Hmm, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I see that it ends with two '#' symbols. In many programming languages, especially those like C or similar, a semicolon is used to end statements, and multiple semicolons can cause issues because each statement must be properly terminated.

Wait, the code has an 'if' statement followed by '@ a = 1;' which might be some kind of operator assignment. Then it's trying to add an else clause with '# else b = 2;'. But then there are two '#' symbols at the end. 

The error message mentions that after the else clause, which is already closed by the parentheses, there's an unexpected '#'. So maybe each '#' represents a line continuation or something? Or perhaps it's just extra characters.

Looking closer, the code ends with ' # else b = 2; #' and another ';' at the end. That might be causing confusion. Wait, no, the structure is:

if (...) @a=1; # else ... ;

So after the if statement, there's a comment-like line starting with '#', then an else clause followed by ';'. Then another '#' at the end.

Wait, in many languages, comments start with # and everything until the end of the line. So having a comment after the if statement might not be intended here. Maybe those '#' signs are meant to represent something else, like continuation lines or maybe part of a different syntax.

But according to the error message, there's an unexpected '#', which is probably because the code has a # where it shouldn't. Perhaps those '#' were mistakenly added after the if and else statements.

So the solution would be to remove those extra '#' signs at the end so that they don't interfere with the code structure. That way, each statement ends properly with a semicolon without any unintended characters.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
