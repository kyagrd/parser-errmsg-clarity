Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code with a syntax error and an error message pointing out the issue. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first off, looking at it, I notice that there are these fancy brackets 《 and 》 which might be part of some syntax in this language. But regardless, the main issue is the syntax error.

Let me break down the code line by line. The line starts with an if statement: if (x > 0). Then inside the parentheses, it's written as () instead of {}. Oh wait, no, actually, looking closer, after the if condition, there are these characters 《 a = 1; 》 and then else b = 2;. That seems off.

I remember that in many programming languages like C or Java, braces {} are used to denote blocks. So maybe here, the code is trying to use some other kind of brackets but isn't closing them properly.

Looking at the first part: 《 a = 1; 》. It looks like an opening bracket followed by a statement and then a closing bracket. Then after that, there's else b=2;. So perhaps the if statement should be enclosed within braces {} to form a block.

So maybe replacing those fancy brackets with standard curly braces would fix it. Let me try rewriting that line:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript or C, the if statement can have only one body without braces, using semicolons for multiple statements inside. However, having an else without a proper opening brace might cause issues.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is meant to use these fancy brackets as part of its syntax. Maybe they are equivalent to something else. But given that in many cases, if you have an else statement after a block, it's better to enclose the condition within braces or parentheses properly.

Another thing I notice is that there are two 》 at the end, which seems like a typo. Probably just one should be there.

So putting it all together, replacing the 《 and 》 with { and }, and removing the extra closing bracket at the end.

The corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense. Now each condition has its own block, which is standard practice to avoid syntax issues when multiple statements are involved.
...done thinking.

The code uses fancy brackets instead of the correct curly braces for conditional blocks and has an extra closing bracket. Replacing these with proper braces fixes the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
