Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's see what the problem is. The user provided a code snippet with an error message indicating a syntax issue. 

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Hmm, I notice that there are angle brackets 《 and 》 being used here. In many programming languages like C or Java, angle brackets aren't used for control structures but for generics or template types. So maybe this code is from a different language where angle brackets are part of the syntax.

Wait, in the if statement, after the condition, there's 《 a = 1; 》 and then else b = 2; followed by another 》. That doesn't look right because an if statement shouldn't have two closing brackets like that. Typically, each control structure has its own opening and closing.

So I think the issue is with the use of angle brackets instead of parentheses or other appropriate symbols. Let me try replacing the 《 and 》 with regular parentheses ( and ). 

Let's rewrite it:
```
if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;
```
Wait, but in some languages, especially those that support named arguments or specific syntax, using ( and ) might not be the best. But considering standard control structures, parentheses are correct for conditions.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use curly braces if this is a block of code inside an if statement. But since the original code didn't have them, perhaps the intended structure was just single statements.

Another thought: in some contexts, especially when using certain interpreters or specific syntax highlighters, angle brackets might be used for specifying something else, but I'm not sure. So replacing 《 and 》 with regular parentheses seems like a reasonable fix based on standard syntax.

So the corrected code should have ( instead of 《 and ) instead of 》 at those points.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) (a = 1;) else b = 2;
```
