Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code snippet here and an error message saying there's a syntax error. The code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I need to fix the syntax error using only the information from the error message and the context provided.

First, looking at the code structure, it seems like someone tried to write an if-else statement but messed up with the brackets or braces. The original code uses angle brackets (《 》) instead of curly braces {} which are typically used in JavaScript for block scoping. So maybe that's part of the issue.

In JavaScript, when you have an if statement without braces, you can only have one statement. But here, it looks like they're trying to spread multiple statements inside the if and else blocks using angle brackets, which isn't valid syntax. That would cause a syntax error because the code isn't properly structured within those angle brackets.

So, I think the solution is to replace the angle brackets with curly braces for both the if and else parts. Let me see:

Original:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Fixed version would be changing those 《 and 》 into { }, so it becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each condition block has its own curly braces, which is the correct syntax in JavaScript. This should fix the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed.
...done thinking.

The code uses angle brackets instead of curly braces for scoping. Replacing them fixes the syntax.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
