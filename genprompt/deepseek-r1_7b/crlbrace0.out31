Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided the code and an error message. Let me see what's wrong here.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, looking at it, I notice the if statement has a closing brace that might be mismatched. Let's break it down.

First line: `if (x > 0) {` – so far okay.
Second line inside: `a = 1; } else b = 2; }` Wait, after the if block closes with }, then there's an else statement followed by another semicolon and a brace. That doesn't look right.

I think the issue is that the code structure isn't correct. The if statement should have its condition evaluate to true or false, and based on that, execute one of two blocks. But here, it looks like after the if block closes with }, there's an else without an opening brace, which doesn't make sense.

So probably, the user intended to write:
if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

Let me check that structure. The if block has braces, and then the else also starts with {. That makes sense because each conditional statement needs its own block.

In the original code, after the first }, which closes the if block, there's an else followed by a semicolon and another brace. This is causing a syntax error because the else isn't properly associated with any condition or block. It should instead have its own opening brace before the statements inside.

So to fix it, I'll add the missing braces around the else clause. The corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

That way, both the if and else conditions have their own blocks with braces, which should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has an incorrect placement of the `else` statement. The `else` keyword is missing its corresponding block of statements and improper closing braces.

Fixed Code:
```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
