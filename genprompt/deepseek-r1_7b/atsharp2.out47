Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code here with a syntax error. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me try to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
I notice there are some comments using `#`, but maybe they're not placed correctly. In many programming languages, comments can't be inside conditionals like if statements unless it's part of the syntax.

So, first, I see that after the if statement, the code has an else clause, but then it's followed by a `#` which is supposed to be a comment. That might not make sense in this context because once the if-else structure is closed with its closing brace or bracket, adding another # after might cause issues.

Wait, actually, looking at the original code, I think there are two separate statements: one inside the if and an else that's outside, but both have semicolons. But then each ends with a `#`, which looks like it's trying to add comments right after them. Maybe that's causing confusion.

In some languages, you can't place a comment right after a statement without proper syntax in between. For example, if you have an else clause followed by a comment, it might be misinterpreted as part of the condition or cause other issues.

So perhaps moving those comments to before the if-else structure would fix the problem. That way, they're correctly placed outside and not interfering with the control flow statements.

Let me try rewriting it. If I take out the `#` from inside the if's semicolon and the else's semicolon and place them at the top as comments, maybe that will resolve the error.

So the corrected code would be:
```
if (x > 0)
  @a = 1;
else
  @b = 2;
```

Wait, but in this case, I removed the semicolons after `@a = 1;` and `else`, because normally you don't have statements inside if-else blocks like that unless it's within another block. So maybe just placing the comments outside without any code is better.

Alternatively, maybe the original intention was to add comments for each case, but in this context, they shouldn't be placed after semicolons inside the conditionals.

Another approach: perhaps the `#` should be at the beginning of each line as a comment. So adjusting that way might fix it.

So putting it all together, I'll adjust the code to have the comments outside and correctly formatted.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @a = 1; else @b = 2;
```
