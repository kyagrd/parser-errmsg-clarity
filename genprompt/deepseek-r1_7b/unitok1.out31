Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem again. The user provided an error message: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)." Hmm, that's a bit confusing because 》 isn't something I recognize as a standard character.

Looking at the code, it's written as:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Wait, let me parse this. The if statement starts with `(x > 0)` and then has `《 a = 1; 》` right after. Then there's an else clause with `else b = 2;` followed by another 》 at the end.

I think the user might have meant that they used some kind of angle bracket or special characters where standard ones were expected. The error mentions '》', which looks like a closing character, perhaps from Chinese punctuation? Maybe it's a typo for '>' instead?

Looking closer, in the code, after `if (x > 0)`, there are these characters: 《 and 》 around `a = 1;`. Then an else clause with `b = 2;` followed by another 》. So the structure is:
- if block
- else block

But the syntax for else in Python is `else:` without any semicolons attached unless it's part of a multi-line or something, but here it seems like they're trying to close the if statement with a 》.

Wait, maybe the user used angle brackets by mistake. In Python, we use parentheses for conditionals, square brackets for lists, curly braces for dictionaries, etc., and colons after keywords like if, else, etc.

So looking at the code, it's likely that instead of using regular parentheses `()` for the if statement, they mistakenly used 《 and 》. But Python expects standard parentheses. Similarly, the closing 》 after the else clause is incorrect because else doesn't need a block ending with } in this context; perhaps the user meant to close the if-else structure but used 》 instead.

So the fix would be to replace the 《 and 》 with regular parentheses `()` around the statements inside the if condition. Also, remove the trailing 》 after the else clause because it's not needed here.

Let me rewrite that:
Original code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
After replacing 《 and 》 with standard (), and removing the last 》, we get:
```
if (x > 0): a = 1;
else: b = 2;
```
But wait, in Python, each statement inside if or else needs to be indented. So perhaps it's better to adjust the code properly.

Wait, but looking back at the original code, after `》` comes `else b = 2;`, which doesn't make sense because else should follow the condition without any semicolon attached in this way. The user probably intended each block (if and else) to have their statements indented under them.

So, putting it all together, replacing the special brackets with standard ones and adjusting indentation:

Corrected code:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

Wait, but in Python, you can also write without semicolons for single-line statements. So maybe it's better to remove the semicolons as well.

But looking at the user's code, they have `;` after each statement inside if and else, which is not standard in Python either. So perhaps that was part of the issue too, but the main error was with the brackets.

So the primary fix is replacing 《 and 》 with regular () around a=1 and adjusting the structure to correctly format the if-else blocks with proper indentation.
...done thinking.

The code has two issues: it uses special brackets `《` and `》` instead of standard parentheses, and there's an extra closing bracket at the end. The fix is to replace these brackets with regular parentheses and remove the trailing one.

```python
if (x > 0): a = 1;
else: b = 2;
```

However, if we want it in Pythonic style without semicolons:

```python
if x>0:
    a=1
else:
    b=2
```

But sticking to the user's original structure for consistency:

The fixed code is:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else: b = 2;
```
