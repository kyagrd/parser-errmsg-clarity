Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Looking at this, I notice that it's using square brackets [] instead of parentheses () for what looks like an if-else statement. In many programming languages, if statements use parentheses, so that might be the issue.

The code inside the first condition is [ a = 1; ], which seems to be incorrect because in an if statement, you usually have something after the condition, not within brackets. Also, the closing bracket ] comes right before else, but I don't think square brackets are used for control structures here.

So, replacing the square brackets with parentheses should fix it. That would change [ a = 1; ] to (a = 1;) and remove the extra brackets in the else part as well because they're not needed.

The corrected code should look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in some languages, using braces {} is preferred for clarity. Since the original used semicolons inside, maybe it's better to keep them on the same line without the extra brackets.

So another way could be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But since the initial code didn't have braces, perhaps using parentheses with semicolons is acceptable. However, considering readability, adding braces might be better.

I think both approaches are valid, but to match the original style as much as possible without changing syntax too drastically, I'll stick with parentheses and remove unnecessary brackets.
...done thinking.

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Error**: The code uses square brackets `[]` around statements inside an if condition, which is incorrect syntax.

2. **Replace Square Brackets with Parentheses**: Replace `[ a = 1; ]` with `(a = 1;)` to follow standard control structure formatting.

3. **Adjust Control Structure**: Remove unnecessary extra parentheses and ensure each condition has its appropriate block of code.

4. **Finalize Code**: The corrected code uses proper if-else syntax without any redundant brackets, making it valid in languages like JavaScript or similar where such constructs are supported with braces `{}` (though parentheses work too).
