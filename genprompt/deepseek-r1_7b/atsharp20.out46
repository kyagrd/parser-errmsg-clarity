Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the problem step by step.

First, the user provided a code snippet with an error message indicating a syntax error. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

I know that in many programming languages, the `if` statement should end with a semicolon or another valid statement. Here, after the `if` block, there's an `@` symbol followed by an assignment and some comments. That might not be correct.

Looking at the error message, it just says "syntax error," so I'm guessing that the issue is with how the statements are structured. In languages like C or Java, each statement inside the if-else block must end with a semicolon. So maybe the `@` isn't part of any valid statement and should be removed.

Wait, the code has `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. The `@` is probably not intended here. Maybe it's a typo or leftover from another context. So removing that might help fix the syntax.

If I take out the `@`, the code becomes:

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

That looks more like valid C or similar syntax, where each statement ends with a semicolon. Also, adding comments as in `//` is fine if they're properly indented.

Another thing to note is that the original code had two semicolons at the end after each comment block, which might not be necessary but could have caused confusion. So removing them makes it cleaner.

So putting it all together, the fixed code should remove the `@` and adjust the structure so each statement ends correctly with a semicolon.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
