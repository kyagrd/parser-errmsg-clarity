Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The user mentioned there's a syntax error, so I need to pinpoint where exactly the issue is.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, let me break this down line by line. First, the if statement: `if (x > 0)` seems okay on its own. But then there's this `@ a = 1` part. I'm not sure what that does. Maybe it's some kind of assignment operator? Wait, in many programming languages, like C or Java, there are specific operators for assignments, but the @ symbol doesn't ring a bell here.

Next, the comment starts with `# else b = 2; #`. That seems off because in most languages, comments start with `//` or `/* */`. Using `#` instead is probably causing an error. Also, putting `else` after `@` might not be correct syntax for whatever language this code is written in.

Putting it all together, the line after the if statement has two parts: one that starts a new statement and another that looks like a comment but isn't properly formatted. The `@` operator doesn't make sense here unless there's a specific context or library involved, which I don't have information about.

Since the error message is just "syntax error," it's likely pointing out that something's wrong with how these statements are structured. Maybe the line breaks or misplaced keywords are causing issues.

I think the main problems are:
1. The `@` operator isn't valid in this context.
2. The use of `#` to start a comment is incorrect; comments usually start with `//` or `/* */`.
3. The placement of "else" after the @ statement doesn't follow proper control flow syntax.

To fix it, I should remove the `@` and adjust how comments are used. Perhaps replacing `@` with something else if necessary, but without more context, maybe it's not needed. Also, adding proper comment markers would resolve any confusion.

So, reorganizing the code to make sense in a standard control flow structure might look like this:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

This way, each condition has its own block with proper assignments and comments. I removed the `@`, fixed the comment syntax, and structured the if-else properly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
