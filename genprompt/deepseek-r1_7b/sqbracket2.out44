Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this syntax error step by step. The user provided a code snippet with an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". 

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I notice that there are two closing brackets `]` which might be causing the issue. The error mentions an unexpected ']', so perhaps one of them is misplaced.

The structure seems to have an if-else statement. The code inside the if block ends with `[ a = 1; ]`, and then the else clause follows, ending with another `]`. That could mean there are too many closing brackets.

Wait, maybe it's about braces instead of square brackets? If this is using curly braces `{}`, then having square brackets `[ ]` might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses different syntax for blocks.

But focusing on the error: unexpected ']' after else clause. So between the if block and the else, there should only be one closing bracket. Let me count:

1. The if statement opens with `(x > 0)` but no braces; maybe it's using square brackets for some reason.
2. Inside the if, they have `[ a = 1; ]`, which is another set of brackets, perhaps intended as an array or something else.
3. Then the else clause: `else b = 2; ]` with an extra closing bracket.

So maybe removing one of the closing brackets would fix it. The error says there's an unexpected ']' after the else, so the last `]` is not needed.

Also, perhaps the square brackets around `a = 1` are unnecessary and causing confusion in block structure.

Let me try to rewrite without the extra brackets:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This uses curly braces for blocks, which is common. The original code had square brackets inside the if condition, but that might not be necessary. Also, having an extra closing bracket at the end would cause the error.

So I'll remove all square brackets and adjust to use proper block syntax with braces. That should fix the unexpected ']' error because there's only one `]` at the end now.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
