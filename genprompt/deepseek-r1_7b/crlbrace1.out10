Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code provided is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that after the else statement, there's another closing brace '}', which might be causing the problem. Let me think about how if statements work in programming. An if-else structure should have each block properly closed with their own braces.

So the original code has:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

After the else statement, there's an extra '}' that doesn't belong. That's probably why the compiler is throwing an error—it thinks there's an unexpected closing brace.

I should check if each block is correctly closed. The first part after if is { a = 1; }, which ends with a single brace. Then comes the else statement followed by b=2 and another '}'. Wait, that second '}' might be for both the else and some other code, but it's not needed here.

So to fix this, I should remove the extra closing brace after the else statement. The correct structure should have two separate blocks: one inside if and another inside else. Each block is enclosed within its own braces.

Let me rewrite the code without the extra '}'. So the corrected version should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, each statement has its own brace pair, and there are no unmatched or unexpected closing braces. This should resolve the syntax error mentioned.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace after the `else` clause which is causing the syntax error. Removing this extra brace fixes the issue.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
