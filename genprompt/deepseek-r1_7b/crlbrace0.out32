Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, first thing I notice is the structure of the if-else statement. In most programming languages like C or Java, an else clause should have braces that match the if's braces. Let me check the code again.

The if condition is correct: (x > 0). Then inside the curly braces, there's a statement a = 1;. That seems fine. But then comes the else part: else b = 2; } Wait, but this is outside another set of braces. Oh no, I think that's the problem.

In many languages, each if-else block must have its own opening and closing braces. Here, the outer if has a single opening brace {, so the else should be inside that same block. But in the code provided, after the else statement, there's another } which is causing an extra brace at the end.

So, looking at the structure:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else b = 2;

But wait, in the given code, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I see now. The else is on the same line as the closing brace for the if statement, but then there's another closing brace at the end which doesn't match anything. That's causing a syntax error because the last } has no corresponding opening brace.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that each brace is properly matched and closed. Let me rewrite the code correctly.

First, ensure that both if and else have their own braces. So:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each block inside the if-else has its own opening and closing braces. The outer if starts with { and ends with }, then the else is in another block starting with { and ending with }.

Putting it all together without any extra spaces for readability:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That should fix the syntax error because each statement inside if and else has its own braces, preventing the mismatch that caused the error.
...done thinking.

The code has an improper structure where the `else` is not enclosed within a matching `{}` block. The fixed code ensures proper brace matching for both the if and else conditions.

```fix
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
