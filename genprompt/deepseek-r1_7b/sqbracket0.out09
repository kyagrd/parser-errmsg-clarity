Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error, and I need to fix it using only the error message provided. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see an if statement here. The condition is x > 0, which seems fine. Then there's this part: [ a = 1; ]. Wait, that's inside square brackets. In JavaScript or similar languages, square brackets are used for arrays or object literals. But in the context of an if statement, I'm not sure how that would work.

So maybe the problem is with using square brackets here. Instead of using [] to denote a block, perhaps it should be a regular block brace { }. Because in JavaScript, you can write code blocks either with {} or [], but [] isn't typically used for control structures like if statements unless you're trying to create an array conditionally, which doesn't make much sense here.

Looking at the rest of the code: after the else clause, there's b = 2; ] But that last ] is outside the square brackets. Oh wait, no—the initial [ a=1; ] ends with ], and then there's another ; ] which closes the if statement. So actually, the structure is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

So maybe the code should be rewritten to use braces instead of square brackets for the block. Let me try rewriting that part.

Instead of [ a=1; ], it should be {a=1;}. That way, the if statement's body is properly enclosed with curly braces. Then, the else clause would follow, ending with its semicolon and then closing the if statement correctly.

So putting it all together, the corrected code would look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in the original code, after the else, there's another ; before ] which might be redundant. So I can remove that extra semicolon to make it cleaner.

Let me check again: if x is greater than 0, set a to 1, else set b to 2. That makes sense and should fix the syntax error because now the code uses curly braces properly.
...done thinking.

The original code incorrectly uses square brackets instead of curly braces for defining block scopes in an `if` statement. The fixed version replaces `[ ]` with `{ }`.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
