Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message is "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code provided is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I notice that there are two closing curly braces here. The first one after `if` and another at the end of the line. Let me count them: 

- After `if`, there's `{ a = 1; }`.
- Then, in the next line, it's `else b = 2; }`.

Wait, so after the else clause, there should only be one closing brace because both conditions are part of the same if statement. But looking at the code, I see that there are two braces: one after the if and another at the end.

So the problem is that the second `}` is incorrectly placed. The else clause should not have its own brace unless it's a multi-line condition with an else if or something, but in this case, it's just else followed by b=2. So I need to remove the extra closing brace.

Let me rewrite the code without the second brace:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That should fix the error because now there's only one `}` after the if statement, and it properly closes both the if block and the else clause. 

I think that's all. The code is fixed by removing the extra closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing curly brace which should be removed to fix the syntax error.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
- The original code had two closing braces, one after `if` and another at the end.
- Only the first brace is needed since it closes both the if condition's block and the else clause.
- Removing the extra brace resolves the syntax error.

The fixed code does not have any syntax errors.
