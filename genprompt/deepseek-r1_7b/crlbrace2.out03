Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means the closing brace is being thrown too soon. Let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement starts with `if (x > 0) {` and then there's an else clause right after without any condition. Wait, no, actually, in this code, the else is directly following the opening brace of the if block. That doesn't make sense because in most programming languages, the else should be part of the same if statement.

So, maybe the problem is that the else isn't properly connected to the if condition. The current structure has an else without a corresponding if after it. So when the code tries to close the else clause, which I think starts at `else`, but actually, in this case, the else is not part of any if statement because there's no matching opening brace.

Let me break it down:

1. The code starts with `if (x > 0) {` - that's correct.
2. Then inside the braces, we have `a = 1; }` but wait, that doesn't look right. Oh, I see, maybe a typo here because there's an extra closing brace? Or perhaps it's just part of the assignment.

Wait no, looking again: after `if (x >0) {`, the next line is `a=1;}`, which seems off. Probably should be `a = 1;` without the extra }.

But actually, in many languages like C or Java, you can't have a statement inside an if block unless it's properly indented and within braces. But here, perhaps the code uses a different syntax where statements don't need indentation but still require proper braces.

So maybe the real issue is that after `if (x>0) {`, there's no corresponding closing brace before the else statement starts. Let me see: The if block has an opening brace, and then inside it, the assignment happens, but then we have `} else...` which isn't right.

Wait, perhaps the code should be structured so that after the if condition, the braces are closed correctly, including any statements within. So maybe the line after the if statement is improperly closing a block or not properly aligned.

Looking at the error message again: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So when it sees the `}` after the else, it's throwing an error because there was no matching opening brace before that.

So perhaps the code should be restructured to have the if-else correctly with their own braces. Let me think about how this should look:

The correct structure would be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

In the original code, after `if (x>0) {`, there's an assignment and then another } which is causing the problem. Also, the else statement isn't properly enclosed within its own braces.

So in the given code:

Line 1: if condition starts
Line 2: a=1;
Line 3: } else b = 2; }
Line 4: }

Wait, that's confusing because there are multiple closing braces. The first `}` after line 2 is causing an error when it hits the else on line 3.

So to fix this, we need to ensure that each opening brace has a corresponding closing brace at the same level and in the correct order.

Let me rewrite the code step by step:

1. Start with `if (x >0) {` - correct.
2. Then inside, add an assignment: `a = 1;`
3. Close the if block correctly after the assignment: `}` should come right after a=1;
4. Now, for the else part, we need to start a new block with its own braces:
   - After the first }, write `else {` so that it's a separate statement.
5. Inside this else block, add the statement: `b = 2;`
6. Finally, close the else block with `}`.

So putting it all together:

```
if (x >0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}
```

This way, each brace is properly closed after its content, and the else clause is correctly associated with the if statement.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace that doesn't match any opening brace. We need to adjust the braces so they are correctly paired.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
