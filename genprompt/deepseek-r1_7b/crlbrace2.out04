Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code here with a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, the error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause. That means somewhere, a curly brace is used incorrectly.

Looking at the code structure: 

- There's an if statement that checks if x > 0.
- Inside the if block, it assigns a=1 and closes with }.
- Then there's an else without any condition, followed by b=2; and another }.

Wait, but in most programming languages, each control structure needs to be properly closed. So here, after the else statement, they're trying to close another block, which isn't correct because the else is part of the if condition.

So maybe the else should have its own condition with braces or not? Let me think about how this code would parse.

In the original code, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

This seems like two separate statements: one inside the if block and another outside. But that can't be right because the else should belong to the if condition.

So perhaps the intended code was something where both conditions have their own blocks, or maybe it's just an else without a condition, which is invalid in some languages but valid in others like JavaScript where you can write else without a condition for multi-line ifs.

Wait, but the error is about an unexpected '}', so probably the structure is causing an extra brace. Let me count the braces:

The if has { }, then after that, there's an } which closes the if block, and then another } at the end of the code outside.

So in the original code, it's like:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

Which would have two closing braces: one for the if, and one at the end. But the else is part of the if statement, so perhaps that extra brace is causing the issue.

So to fix this, I need to make sure the braces are correctly closed in the right order.

Looking again, maybe the code should be written as:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } 
else {
    b=2;
}

But wait, in that case, after else, we have another block. But in the original code, it's written without braces around else and its assignment.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write it as an if-else where each has their own block:

if (x>0) { a=1; } 
else {
    b=2;
}

But that would require adding opening and closing braces after else. Let me see how many braces we have in the original code.

Original code: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So the structure is:

- if condition { ... } else statement;

Which is incorrect because else should be part of an if-else structure, which would require braces around both conditions or proper nesting.

Wait, maybe in JavaScript, you can have else without a condition when using multi-line ifs. But in this case, perhaps it's more about the placement of the braces.

Let me try to rewrite the code so that all braces are correctly matched and closed only once.

Looking at the original code again:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

It has an if block with one }, then after that, another } before the end. So perhaps the structure is causing two closing braces in a row somewhere.

So to fix this, I need to adjust where the braces are placed. Maybe the else should be inside its own block without conflicting with the existing brace.

Wait, maybe the correct way is:

if (x > 0) { 
    a =1; 
} else {
    b=2;
}

But that would add more braces than necessary if we don't use them unnecessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be split into two separate statements without using extra braces unless needed.

Wait, another approach: maybe in JavaScript, you can have an else statement after a single brace. So the original code might actually mean:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

Which would translate to:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
}
else
    b=2;

But in this case, the else is not followed by any braces, so it's just an else statement. However, that might be acceptable in some languages but cause issues with indentation and blocks.

Wait, but the error message says there's an unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So probably, the code has a misplaced brace.

So perhaps the original code should have braces only where needed.

Looking again: 

The if block is {a=1; }, then the else is followed by b=2;, and another } at the end. That means that after the else clause, there's an extra } which closes the outer block incorrectly.

Wait, but in reality, when you have:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

This would mean:

- The if condition is checked.
- If true, execute a=1 and close with }.
- Else, execute b=2 and then close the outer block.

But that's not correct because the else should be part of an if statement. So perhaps in this context, the code is intended to have both branches (if and else) each having their own blocks, but it's incorrectly structured.

So maybe the fix is to correctly place the braces so that each if-else condition has its own block.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake by not using braces for the else clause. So adding { } around the else statement would solve the issue.

Wait, let me try to visualize:

Original code:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else b=2; }

This can be broken down as:

- if (x>0) {
   a = 1;
} else
   b = 2;
}

But that's not correct because the else is not within any block, so it would close the outer brace prematurely.

Wait, but in reality, when you write:

if (condition) { ... } else ...;

In many languages, the else must be followed by a statement and then can be closed with or without braces. But if the else's statement doesn't have braces, it should still not cause syntax errors unless improperly placed.

But perhaps the code is intended to have two separate statements: one inside the if block and another outside. In that case, both assignments would need their own blocks.

Wait, maybe the user intended:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

Which adds braces around each assignment.

But in this case, does that cause any issues?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use consistent formatting with opening and closing braces for readability.

So considering all this, I think the correct fix is to properly place the braces so that they don't cause an unexpected } error. That would involve ensuring each block has its own set of braces.
...done thinking.

The code contains a syntax error due to an extra closing brace (`}`) placed incorrectly after the else statement. The brace should be moved inside the else block or removed if it's not needed.

Here is the fixed code with proper formatting:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This places both statements within their respective braces, ensuring there are no syntax errors.
