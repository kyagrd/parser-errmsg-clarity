Thinking...
Alright, let's see what's going on here. The user provided some code with a syntax error and an error message. They want me to fix it without prior knowledge of the programming language, but using only the error message they received.

The error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, so there's something wrong with the closing brackets here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that they're using '《' and '》' instead of regular '>' or '<'. These might be Unicode characters for greater than and less than, but in this context, maybe they should just use standard symbols.

The code starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then inside the parentheses, it's written as `《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》` which doesn't look right. 

First, I think that after closing the if condition `(x > 0)`, they have an else clause: `else b = 2;`. But in their code, after the if's closing bracket '》', they have the else statement.

Wait, maybe they mistakenly used '》' instead of '>' for both the if and else clauses. So perhaps replacing those with standard '>' would fix it.

Let me try rewriting that part:

Original problematic line: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`

If I replace '《' and '》' with '>' then it becomes:

`if (x > 0) > a = 1; else b = 2; >`

But that doesn't look right because the structure is off. The if's closing bracket should come first, followed by the colon, then the indented block, then the else part.

Wait, actually, in some languages like JavaScript or Python, after an if statement without a body (i.e., no indented block), you can just have `else`. But here, they're trying to assign a value based on the condition.

Alternatively, maybe the correct structure should be:

`if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`

So in this case, replacing '《' and '》' with curly braces would fix it. That makes sense because using angle brackets for if/else is not standard.

Therefore, the corrected code should replace the unusual brackets with curly braces.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
