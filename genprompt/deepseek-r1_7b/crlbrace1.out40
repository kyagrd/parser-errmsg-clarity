Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message and the original code. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that suggests there's a problem with the curly braces around an if statement. 

Looking at the code: 
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
I notice that the if statement starts with `{` and ends with `}`, which is correct for that part. Then there's an else clause, but it seems like the syntax after the else isn't right.

Wait, in the code, after the else, it just says `b=2; }`. Oh! I see what's wrong here. The else statement should be followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces if it has multiple lines or statements. Right now, it looks like they're trying to write `else b=2` but forgot the opening brace `{`. So, without that, the code is expecting another closing brace `}`, which doesn't exist.

So the correct structure should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
By adding the missing `{` after else and its corresponding `}` before the semicolon, it fixes the syntax error. That way, both if and else blocks have their own braces correctly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
