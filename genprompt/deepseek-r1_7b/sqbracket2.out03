Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me take a look at what's given.

The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

And the error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means the if statement already closed. Hmm, that makes sense because in the code, the if block ends with a ] and then another ] at the end of the line.

I remember that in programming languages like C or Java, when you have an if-else structure, each block is enclosed within curly braces {}. So maybe the original code was using square brackets [] instead of braces. That's probably why there's a syntax error—it's expecting the closing brace for the else clause but found a ] instead.

Looking at the code again: inside the if condition, it has [ a = 1; ], which should be { a = 1; } with curly braces. Then outside the block, after the if statement, there's an else followed by b=2 and another ]. But since the entire if-else is supposed to be within the same block, having that extra ] at the end is incorrect.

So I think the solution is to replace both square brackets [] with curly braces {}. Let me adjust that. The corrected code should have { a = 1; } inside the if and remove the extra ] after else.

Wait, actually, looking again, the code has [ a = 1; ] else b=2; ]. So the if block is enclosed in [], but then there's an else without braces, which is wrong. So replacing those [] with {} should fix it. Then the else part doesn't need a block because the code after else would be outside of any block, but since we're only changing the brackets, perhaps that line can just end normally.

So putting it all together: The if statement has its body in curly braces, and the else is followed by b=2; without any additional braces. That should fix the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
