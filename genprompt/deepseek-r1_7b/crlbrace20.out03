Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error, and I need to fix it based on the error message provided. Let me look at the code carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, first off, I notice that there's an extra closing brace after the else statement. In most programming languages, each if-else block should have exactly one opening and one closing brace. Here, it looks like the if condition has its own block with a semicolon inside, and then the else is followed by another semicolon and another closing brace. So that's definitely an issue.

Also, looking at the indentation, I think in many languages, including some C-like structures, the else should align with the if statement. The code after else doesn't have any braces, so maybe it's supposed to be within the same block as a; but since there's no opening brace for that, it's causing an error.

Wait, let me parse this line by line. The first line is if (x > 0) { which starts a block. Inside that block, a =1; is correct because it has braces. Then the else statement comes in: } else b=2; }. So after else, there's another closing brace, but that would be for what? Because in C or Java, each if-else must have braces covering their entire body.

So probably, the code is trying to write an else without a corresponding block. Or maybe it's missing a brace at the end of the else part. Let me think: after the else statement, we should have another block, so the corrected code should be } else { b=2; }, and then close both if and else with their own braces.

Alternatively, perhaps in some languages like JavaScript or PHP, you can write it without braces for simple statements, but that's not standard practice. It might cause issues, especially when the code gets more complex.

Wait, looking at the original code again: after else b=2; }, which is missing a brace before the semicolon. So in reality, the if statement opens with {, then inside it has a=1;. Then comes } else b=2; }, meaning an extra closing brace. That's wrong because each if must have its own block.

So to fix this, I should adjust the structure so that the else is within the same block as the if and also properly closed.

I think the correct code would be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

Yes, because each condition inside an if-else must have its own braces. The original code had two closing braces, which is incorrect. So by adding another brace after else and closing it properly, the syntax should be fixed.
...done thinking.

The error message indicates a syntax issue due to extra closing braces. The corrected code ensures proper brace matching for each condition.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
