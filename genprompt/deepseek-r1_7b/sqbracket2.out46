Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error, but it's giving me an unexpected ']' after the else clause. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, looking at this, I notice that inside the if statement, there's something between parentheses and then a semicolon with square brackets. Maybe it's trying to create an array or something.

Wait, in many programming languages like JavaScript, you can have objects within conditions using curly braces. Oh right! So instead of using square brackets for arrays, maybe I should switch to curly braces to define an object here.

So the line if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] is probably incorrect because it's using square brackets where objects or arrays are usually defined with curly braces.

Let me rewrite that part. Instead of [ a = 1; ], I'll change it to { a: 1; } because in JS, you can have object literals with colon syntax inside conditions like that.

So now the code would look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Does this make sense? Let me check. The if condition is correctly closed with }, then the block has an object literal, and the else part follows properly without any extra brackets or semicolons.

I think that's it! This should fix the syntax error because now both conditions have their blocks defined with curly braces instead of square brackets.
...done thinking.

The code incorrectly uses square brackets `[ ]` where array literals should typically use curly braces `{ }`. Additionally, the `else` statement is missing its closing brace. Here's the fixed version:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
