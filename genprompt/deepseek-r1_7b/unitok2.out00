Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in a piece of code. Let me look at the problem again. The user provided an error message and some code. 

The code is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

And the error message says: unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)

Hmm, I remember that in many programming languages like Java or C, curly braces are used around if statements. But here, it seems like they're using different symbols—brackets and angle brackets instead.

Looking at the code, I see "《" which is a left bracket and then "》", the right one. Then after else, there's another 》. Wait, maybe these should be curly braces { } because if statements typically use them for block structures.

Let me think about how the code is structured. The if statement starts with (x > 0), followed by some code inside. Then it closes the if clause with 《 and 》. But after else, there's another 》 which doesn't belong there because the previous one should have closed the if block.

So I think the mistake is that they used angle brackets instead of curly braces for the if statement. So the corrected code should use { and } around the entire if-else structure.

Let me rewrite it step by step. The original code uses 《 a =1; 》 which probably should be {a=1;}. Then, after else, they have b=2;. But then there's an extra 》 at the end, which is incorrect because that would close the if statement again or cause a syntax error.

So I'll replace the angle brackets with curly braces. The corrected code should look like this: if (x >0) {a=1; } else {b=2;}. Wait, but in some languages, it's allowed to have only one block after else. Alternatively, maybe just removing the extra 》 at the end.

Putting it all together, the fixed code would be:

if (x>0){ a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense because each if and else clause needs its own curly braces to denote the block of code. Also, I removed the trailing angle bracket which was causing the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
