Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and the original code. Let me see what's going on here.

First, looking at the code: it's written as if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }. Hmm, that seems off to me. I notice there are two closing braces here. The first part is inside the if statement, and then after the else, there's another brace at the end.

The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". That suggests that there's an extra closing brace somewhere. Let me break it down.

In the code, the structure is:
- If condition: { a = 1; } → this is correct.
- Else clause: else b = 2; } → here, I see that after 'else', there's another }. But wait, the if statement only had one }, so having two at the end would cause an extra brace.

So, the original code has three parts:
1. The opening { for the if block.
2. The statements inside (a=1;).
3. Then a } which closes the if block.
4. Then 'else b = 2;' and another }, but this isn't necessary because there's no else-if chain here.

Wait, maybe the user intended to have both branches within one big brace? Or perhaps it was supposed to be an if-else without nested blocks.

Looking again, the code is written as:
if (x >0) { a=1; } else b =2; }

But that would mean after 'else', there's another }, which isn't needed because there's no statement following else. So it's just an else followed by a statement and then a closing brace.

Wait, perhaps the code was intended to be something like:
if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

That way, both if and else have their own braces. But in the original code, after 'else', there's just b=2; without braces. Then an extra } is at the end.

So the problem is that there are two closing braces: one for the if block and another unnecessary one at the end.

Therefore, to fix it, I should remove the extra brace. So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That way, each clause has its own }, and there's no trailing brace.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
