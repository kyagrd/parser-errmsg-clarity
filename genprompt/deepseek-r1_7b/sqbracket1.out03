Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code they gave:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that right after the if condition, there's a closing bracket ']', and then an else statement followed by another bracket. That might be causing the issue.

Wait, in the code, the first part is written as (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]. Is this supposed to be an if-else structure? Maybe they intended to have two separate statements inside each condition but mistakenly used brackets instead of proper syntax.

I remember that in JavaScript or similar languages, you don't need brackets around the assignments unless it's part of an object literal or array. So perhaps the original code was trying to assign a and b based on the condition but used incorrect syntax.

Let me break it down: "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;" should probably be written as:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But the user didn't use braces. Alternatively, without braces, each condition's statement needs to be on its own line and properly indented if using single-line syntax.

Looking back at the code, after the first ']', there's an 'else' followed by another ']' which is causing a problem. So maybe removing those extra brackets would fix it.

So I'll rewrite the code without the unnecessary brackets. That should eliminate the syntax error because each else statement will be correctly placed under its respective if condition.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
