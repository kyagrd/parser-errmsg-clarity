Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some JavaScript code. The user provided an error message and the faulty code. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the error message says: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". So, there's an extra closing bracket that doesn't belong there.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Hmm, I see an if statement with a condition. Inside, there's `[ a = 1; ]`, which looks like it might be trying to define some variables or maybe an array? But the brackets are here and then after the else clause another closing bracket is present.

Wait, in JavaScript, when you write something inside an if block, you don't use square brackets unless you're creating an array. So, `[ a = 1; ]` might be intended to create an empty array or maybe some variables, but it's followed by a 'else' and another bracket which is causing the problem.

The code ends with `]`, so after the else statement, there's an extra closing square bracket that doesn't match. The parser probably sees this as unexpected because it's trying to close something that wasn't opened properly.

Let me break it down step by step. The if condition is correctly written: `(x > 0)`. Inside, someone wrote `[ a = 1; ]`—maybe they meant to use an object or array literal but forgot the commas and colons? Or perhaps it's trying to assign `a` as 1 within some structure.

But more importantly, after the else clause, there's another `]`. Since the if statement is followed by an else, which is a single-line statement, each block should be properly closed. The code has `[ ]` inside the if and then another `]` at the end, making it two closing brackets where one is needed.

So, perhaps the intention was to have something within the if block but without adding unnecessary brackets. Alternatively, maybe they intended to use an array or object with proper syntax.

But looking back, the code as written has `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The first bracket starts after the condition, then inside, there's some code, and then the else statement ends, followed by another closing bracket. That extra `]` is causing the error because it doesn't have a matching opening brace.

So to fix this, I think the square brackets around `[ a = 1; ]` are unnecessary or misplaced. Maybe they were trying to create an array but didn't format it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps those brackets should be removed entirely if their purpose is not serving any function in that context.

If we remove the square brackets and just leave `a = 1; else b = 2;`, then the code would make sense without causing a syntax error because there are no extra closing brackets anymore.

So the corrected code would look like:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
Wait, but in the original code, they used `[` and `]`, so maybe they were trying to create an array. However, without any commas or proper syntax inside the brackets, it's not valid JavaScript.

Alternatively, perhaps those brackets should be removed because their inclusion is causing confusion with block scopes. The code as given uses semicolons, which suggests that each line is a statement on its own, so using `[` and `]` might have confused the parser into thinking they're part of an array when in reality, it's just code inside the if.

Therefore, removing those brackets should fix the syntax error because now there are no extra closing braces left hanging. The else clause will correctly end with a semicolon without needing another bracket.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
