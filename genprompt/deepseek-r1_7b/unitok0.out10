Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me take a look at the problem step by step.

First, looking at the code given: 

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that there are these fancy brackets 《 and 》 being used instead of regular parentheses. Maybe they're trying to use some kind of formatting or they're not recognized correctly in this context.

I remember from basic syntax rules that the if statement should have a condition followed by an opening brace {, then the code block inside, and then a closing brace }. So here, the user has used 《 and 》 instead of { and }, which is causing a syntax error because Python doesn't recognize those characters as braces.

So the main issue is the use of 《 and 》. I should replace them with regular curly braces { and }. Let me rewrite that part correctly.

Looking at the code again, it's written like this: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I need to change both 《 and } to {. So the corrected line should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, let me make sure. The original code has two closing 》 brackets, which are after the if block and after the else statement. That's another issue because each if-else structure should have one opening and one closing brace.

In the original code, only the first part has braces, but it's not correctly placed. So by replacing 《 with { and } with }, I fix both issues: using proper syntax for braces and ensuring each block is properly closed.

So putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

I think that's it. Replacing those characters fixes the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect brace characters. Replacing them with standard curly braces fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
