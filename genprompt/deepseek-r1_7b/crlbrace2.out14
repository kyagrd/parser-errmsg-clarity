Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I see that there are two closing braces: one for the if block and another after the else. But maybe the syntax is off because of how they're placed.

Wait, in most programming languages, each if statement's block ends with a single brace. So here, the if condition has its own block with curly braces. Then, the else clause should be part of that same if statement, right?

But looking at the code, after the if block closes with }, there's an else statement followed by another {. That might not make sense because the else is supposed to be part of the if statement.

So maybe the issue is that the else and its braces are outside the main if block. Let me try to structure it correctly.

I think the correct code should have the else inside the same braces as the if. So instead of having an extra opening brace after else, it should just end with } right after the else statement.

So rewriting the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but I only need to fix the syntax error using the braces mentioned in the error message. The error was about an unexpected '}' after else, which suggests that there are too many closing braces.

Looking again at the original code: it ends with two } and a semicolon. That might be causing the issue because the second brace is not needed.

So maybe I should remove the extra brace before the else statement.

Wait no, the error message says unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So perhaps the if statement's block was closed correctly, but then there are more braces which are causing an error.

In other words, the code has:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So two closing braces: one for the if and another extra. The second brace is unexpected because after that, there's no statement to close it.

So perhaps I should remove the extra brace before else.

Wait, but in reality, the code as written has:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

Which means line 1 ends with }, then another } at the end. So maybe the second brace is causing an issue because it's expecting more statements after that.

Wait no, in JavaScript, for example, you can't have extra braces without corresponding code. But in this case, perhaps the code has a semicolon at the end of the if block, and then else with its own { }, but maybe the structure is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is to close the entire if-else statement within a single pair of braces.

Wait no, because in most languages, each if can have only one else clause. So the original code might be trying to include both branches within their respective blocks.

But looking at the code again: it's written as:

if (x>0) {a=1; } else b=2;

So that would mean two separate statements inside an outer block, but I think in JavaScript, you can't have multiple statements unless they're all part of a single block.

Wait no, each if and else is within its own braces. So the code as written has:

if (x>0) {a=1; } // this closes with }
else b=2; // then another }, but that's not part of an if statement anymore.

That would cause a syntax error because the second brace doesn't have any matching opening brace after else.

So to fix it, I think the code should be:

if (x>0) {a=1; } else {b=2;}

Wait no, because then else is inside its own block. But in JavaScript, you can write multiple statements on one line without braces, but when using braces, each statement must have its own.

But perhaps the correct way is to close the if-else properly with a single brace pair.

Alternatively, maybe the code should be structured as:

if (x>0) {a=1;} else {b=2;}

Yes, that's better. So I'll adjust the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

The issue was an extra closing brace after the `else` statement without proper nesting. The corrected code properly closes each block with a single brace pair.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
