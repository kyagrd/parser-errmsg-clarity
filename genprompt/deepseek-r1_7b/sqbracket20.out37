Thinking...
Alright, let's take a look at this code and see what's wrong with it. The user provided an if statement that's causing a syntax error. 

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Hmm, I notice that the condition in the if statement is written as `(x > 0)` but then inside the parentheses, it's `[ a = 1; ]` instead of curly braces. In many programming languages like C or Java, you use `{}` to denote block scopes for if statements. So maybe this code isn't using curly braces and expects them.

Looking at the else statement, it ends with `else b = 2; ]`. The closing bracket might be causing a syntax error because there's an extra closing brace missing before the semicolon. If I remove the square brackets around `[ a = 1; ]` and change it to curly braces `{ a = 1; }`, that should fix the issue.

So, putting it all together, the corrected code should have the if block using curly braces without the brackets inside. The else statement would follow correctly with its own semicolon.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
