Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, first off, the error message says there's a syntax error. So I need to figure out what's wrong with this code.

Looking at the if statement: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Wait, after the else keyword, there's just 'b = 2;' without an opening brace. That doesn't look right because in most programming languages like C or Java, each block of code inside the if statement needs to be indented and separated by braces.

So maybe the issue is that the else block isn't properly enclosed. Let me check: The if condition has a block { a = 1; }, but then the else doesn't have its own block. Instead, it's just 'b = 2;' right after the else without braces or an opening brace for the new block.

I think what should happen is that both the if and else parts should be enclosed in their own braces to make the code structure clear and avoid any confusion. So I'll add an opening brace after else and close it before the next statement, which is the semicolon at the end of the line.

So rewriting the code: The if block remains as { a = 1; }, then the else should start with an opening brace to properly define its scope. That way, both conditions are correctly enclosed within their own blocks.

Putting it all together, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes, that makes sense now. Each condition has its own block with braces, so the syntax error should be fixed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
