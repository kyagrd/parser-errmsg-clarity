Thinking...
Okay, so I have to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The code is:
``` if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; } ```

Hmm, first off, I know that Python uses indentation for its blocks, unlike some other languages like Java or C++. So the initial line doesn't have proper indentation. The condition is "if (x > 0)", but it's not indented after the if statement.

Wait, looking closer, there are two closing braces at the end: `}` and another `}`. That's probably causing a syntax error because each block should only have one closing brace.

So let me break this down:

1. The code starts with "if (x > 0) {", which is correct in Python.
2. Then inside, there's "a = 1;" – that seems fine.
3. Next line is "else b = 2; }" – here I notice two closing braces: one for the else clause and another at the end.

Wait, but in Python, each block should have only one closing brace or parenthesis. So after the if statement, there's a { which should close with one }, not multiple.

Looking again, the code has "}" twice. Once right after else, and then another } at the end. That's incorrect because it causes an extra closing brace before the final one is needed for the main function or whatever is enclosing this code.

So to fix it:

- I need to adjust the indentation of the if block so that everything inside is properly indented.
- Remove the duplicate closing braces and ensure there's only one at the end.

Let me rewrite it step by step.

Original code with proper formatting issues:
```python
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

The main issues are:

1. The condition starts without proper indentation.
2. There's an extra closing brace which causes the syntax error.

So fixing it:

- Indent the if block and its contents properly.
- Remove the duplicate braces so that only one { and one } remain, correctly enclosing the statements.

Final code should be:
```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

Wait, but in Python, after each if statement, you can have multiple indented blocks. So I think that's correct.
...done thinking.

The original code has issues with incorrect indentation and an extra closing brace. The fix involves proper indentation of the statements under the `if` and `else` conditions and ensuring only one final closing brace.

```python
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Fixed Code:
```python
if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
