Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error message is "syntax error," and they want me to only use that information without any pre-trained knowledge. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the code provided:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces at the end: `}` and then another one. Wait, no, actually, it's just an extra brace after the else statement. So let me count them again.

The code starts with if (x>0), then inside the block, a=1; is correct. Then there's an else followed by b=2;. But the closing braces are off. The first if has its opening brace correctly, but the else doesn't have its own opening brace. So after 'else', it should be another { before placing b=2;. Without that, the code is trying to close the outer block prematurely.

So the line with else b = 2; is missing an opening brace. Therefore, I need to add a { right after 'else'. That would fix the syntax because now both the if and else clauses have their own blocks enclosed properly.

Let me write that out:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
Now, I should check again to make sure there are no extra or missing braces. The first block is enclosed within two braces: one opening and one closing. Same for the else clause. Also, only one closing brace at the end of the entire code, which wraps both conditions.

I think that's all. So adding the { after 'else' should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
