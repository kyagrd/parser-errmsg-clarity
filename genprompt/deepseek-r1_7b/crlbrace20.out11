Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix a syntax error in this code. The user provided an error message saying there's a syntax error and showed some code. Let me look at the code they gave:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, first off, I notice that it ends with a semicolon after the closing brace of the else statement. But wait, in programming, each statement should end with a semicolon if you're using a language like C or Java where statements are terminated that way. However, looking at how this is structured, maybe it's part of another construct.

Wait, the code has an if-else structure. The user mentioned that the syntax might be different from languages like C, Java, Python, etc., but I'm not sure which one they're referring to. But in general, let me check for common syntax issues.

In many programming languages, the else clause doesn't require a block if it's just a single statement. So maybe the code is trying to write:

if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else b = 2;

But without any braces around the else part, which might not be necessary in some cases, but perhaps that's causing an issue.

Wait, looking again at the original code: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I see that after the if block ends with }, then there's an else statement without braces and it ends with another semicolon. But in many languages, if you have an else without a preceding if block or without proper syntax, it might cause a parse error.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the else is not properly connected to the if condition. Maybe the code should be structured such that each control structure is correctly closed before the next starts.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with missing braces for the else part. If we add braces around 'b = 2', it would make the syntax clearer and avoid potential issues.

So perhaps changing it to:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That way, both the if and else blocks are properly enclosed with braces. This should fix any parsing issues because each block is clearly separated and ends correctly.

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript or PHP, you don't need braces for single statements, but adding them doesn't hurt and makes it more readable. So maybe that's why the user is asking to use symbols from the error message. Since the error was a syntax error, perhaps using braces is part of fixing it.

Alternatively, another thought: Maybe the code is in a language where semicolons are used differently. But I think adding braces would be the safest fix here.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace and improper structure. Adding braces around each statement fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
