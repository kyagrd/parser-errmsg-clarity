Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some code. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error" and the code that's supposed to be fixed. Let me try to figure out what's wrong here.

First, I'll look at the given code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, okay, so there are two lines here. The first line starts with an if statement: `if (x > 0)`. Then it has this part `@ a = 1;` which I'm not sure about. The second line is trying to handle the else case but ends up with `else b = 2;` and there's also a hashtag at the end.

I remember that in programming, especially in languages like C or C++, the ternary operator can be used instead of an if-else statement for concise code. Maybe the user intended to use this approach.

Looking closely, the line starts with `@`, which isn't valid syntax in most languages I know. I think that's a typo because in C/C++, the correct way is to use `?:` as the ternary operator. So perhaps they meant to write `?:`.

Also, the code has some hashtags at the end: `# else b = 2; #`. That seems out of place. In C, the `#` is used for preprocessor directives. If this is inside a function or block where it's not allowed, that would cause issues.

Putting this together, maybe they intended to write an if-else statement using the ternary operator but made some syntax mistakes. So replacing `@` with `?:` and removing those hashtags at the end of each line should fix the problem.

So the corrected code would look like:

```
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```

This makes sense because it's using the ternary operator to assign either 1 or 2 based on whether x is greater than 0. Also, the hashtags are removed since they were probably leftovers from some other code.
...done thinking.

The original code has two issues: an incorrect character `@` which should be replaced with the C-style ternary operator `?:`, and trailing hashtag symbols `#` that aren't needed here.

To fix it:
1. Replace `@` with `:?`
2. Remove the trailing `#` from each line to avoid syntax errors.

The corrected code is:

```
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```
