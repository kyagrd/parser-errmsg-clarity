Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's causing an error. The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me see what's going on here.

Looking at the code: it's using a ternary operator for the if condition. So it's written as `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Wait, I remember that in Ruby, the ternary operator is like condition ? expr1 : expr2. But here, after the else part, there's a semicolon and then another line starting with '#', which looks like it's trying to comment out something.

But the error says there's an unexpected '#' right after the else clause. Oh, I think that's because in Ruby, you can't have code after the end of an if statement unless it's properly indented or part of a block. So here, after `if (x > 0) @a =1;`, the next line starts with '#', which is actually the start of a comment, but where it shouldn't be.

Wait, no. Looking closer, maybe the issue is that there are two semicolons at the end. The code ends with `# else b=2; #` so after the closing parenthesis of the if statement, there's an else clause followed by a semicolon and then another comment line starting with '#'. But Ruby doesn't allow having statements outside any block or condition unless they're part of a multi-line block.

So to fix this, I think we should remove those extra lines. The ternary operator can handle the else part in one line. So instead of writing it as two separate lines, we should combine everything into one line without any unnecessary comments.

So the corrected code would be removing the second semicolon and the comment lines. That way, after `@a =1;`, we just have an else clause written directly there.

Let me try rewriting it: if (x>0) @a=1 else @b=2;. Yes, that should do it.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1 else @ b = 2;
```
