Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the error is a "syntax error," which usually means there's something wrong with the structure or grammar of the code. Let me look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement seems to be correctly structured, but maybe there are issues with how it's written. First, let me break down the code.

The if condition is `(x > 0)`, which looks fine. Then inside the block, they have `a = 1;`—that seems okay too. The else part is on a new line: `else b = 2;`. Wait, but in an if-else statement, each block should be properly indented or structured.

I see that after the else keyword, there's no opening brace `{` before writing `b = 2;`. That could be the problem. Without the opening brace, the code thinks that `else b = 2;` is a standalone statement outside both if and else blocks, which isn't valid syntax because it's not part of any condition.

So the structure should probably look like this:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But in their code, they didn't add the opening braces after `else` and before each block. Also, I notice that there's an extra closing brace at the end of the code snippet which might be causing another issue.

Wait, looking again, the original code ends with `}` but only one. In the corrected version, there should be two closing braces: one for the outer if statement and another for the else block. So I think adding the opening and closing braces after else is necessary.

Putting it all together, the fixed code would have each block (if and else) enclosed within their own braces. That way, the syntax is correct because each statement inside an if or else condition knows where its block starts and ends.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
