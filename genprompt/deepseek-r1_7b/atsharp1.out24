Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code provided:

```python
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Wait, I'm not sure if this is Python or another language. The error message mentions an unexpected '#', which seems like it's coming from outside of a string or comment maybe? Or perhaps the '#' symbol is causing an issue here.

Looking at the code structure: there's an 'if' statement that checks (x > 0) and then does @a =1; followed by a #. Then another line with else b=2; followed by another #. The error says there's an unexpected '#', so maybe the '#' is being interpreted as ending a string or comment, but it's placed where it shouldn't be.

In Python, comments start with #, so having two #s might not be intended here. Alternatively, if these are separate lines, perhaps the # isn't supposed to be there at all. Or maybe it's trying to use a shebang line but that doesn't fit because shebang is for Unix scripts, not standard Python.

Wait, looking again: The code has an 'if' statement with some operations and then an else part after two #'s. Maybe the original intention was just to have those lines commented out or as part of a conditional block. But in this case, since it's outside any function or class, perhaps they were meant to be comments but instead placed there by mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to include an else clause after the if statement, but with some extra syntax errors. So the #s might not belong there at all, and removing them would fix the issue.

So I think the correct approach is to remove those two '#' symbols because they're causing unexpected syntax by being left alone without a string or comment attached. That way, the code will have proper structure: an if statement followed by else clause correctly placed.
...done thinking.

To fix the error caused by the unexpected '#' symbol after the else clause in the given code:

```python
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;  # else b = 2;
```

The solution is to remove the trailing '#' symbols that appear after each statement. These characters cause syntax errors because they are not part of any valid construct.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; 
else b = 2;
```
