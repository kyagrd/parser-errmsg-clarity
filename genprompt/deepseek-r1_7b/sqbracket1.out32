Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided some code that has a syntax error and an error message about an unexpected ']' after an else clause in an if statement. I need to fix this without using any pre-trained knowledge, just based on the error message.

First, looking at the code: it's written as `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Hmm, that doesn't look right. In programming languages like C or Java, for example, if-else statements are usually written with curly braces `{}` to enclose the block of code. But here, I see square brackets `[]` instead.

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after else. So maybe the extra ] is causing a problem because it's closing a bracket that wasn't opened properly. Let me check the structure:

- The if statement starts with `(x > 0) [`, which uses square brackets.
- Then inside, `a = 1;` is fine.
- The closing of the if block is `]`.
- Then comes the else clause: `else b = 2; ]`.

Wait a second, after the else, there's another `]`. That might be causing the issue. Because in many languages, you don't need an opening brace `{` for simple statements like this, but you do need to close the if block correctly.

So perhaps replacing the square brackets with curly braces would fix it. Let me see:

Original code:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

If I change the [] to {}, then the structure becomes:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense. The if block starts with { after the condition and ends before the closing brace of the outer function or class, which in this case is at the end.

But wait, does this change introduce any new issues? Let me think. In JavaScript or other similar languages, using {} for if-else is correct because you don't need to specify a block type unless it's an empty statement or has multiple lines. So replacing [] with {} should fix the syntax error.

Also, there's that extra `]` at the end of the else clause in the original code: `else b = 2; ]`. That was probably a mistake because after the else block, you don't need another ]. The correct structure is just `else <code>`, without an additional closing bracket. So removing that last `]` would fix it.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should use curly braces around the if condition and remove the extra closing bracket at the end of the else part. That way, the syntax error is resolved because we're properly enclosing the if block with {} instead of [], which wasn't standard in most programming languages for simple statements.
...done thinking.

The original code incorrectly uses square brackets `[]` to enclose an if statement's condition and its body, while also having an extra closing bracket. In many programming languages (like JavaScript), you should use curly braces `{}` for if blocks instead of square brackets.

Here is the fixed code:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

The changes made:
- Replaced `[` with `{` to properly enclose an if statement.
- Removed the extra closing `]` at the end of the else clause.
