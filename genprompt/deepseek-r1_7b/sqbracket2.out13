Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me break down what's happening here.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I notice that there are two closing brackets. The first part is `if (x > 0) [ ... ]` which seems like an if statement with some blocks inside. Then, after the closing bracket of the if statement, there's an `else` clause followed by a semicolon and another closing bracket.

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. That means somewhere in the code, there are too many brackets close together. Let me check where that is.

In the original code, after the first if statement closes with `]`, there's an `else` followed by a semicolon and another `]`. So it looks like we have two closing brackets right after each other: one from the if statement and then another one at the end of the else block. But according to the error, only one is expected.

So probably, the code shouldn't have both brackets there. The second `]` might be unnecessary or misplaced. Let me think about what this code was supposed to do.

If it's an if-else structure in some kind of syntax that supports compound conditions, maybe each condition has a block enclosed within square brackets. So perhaps after else, we shouldn't have another closing bracket but just the statement.

So I should remove the last `]` because it's causing an unexpected end of the code or misplacement. That way, the if-else structure is properly closed with only one ] at the beginning and then a semicolon for the else part without an extra ].

Testing that: After removing the last ], the code would be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

This way, each block inside the if condition is properly enclosed, and the else statement doesn't have any trailing brackets. The error should be resolved because there's no extra closing bracket causing an issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```

The original code had two closing brackets which caused an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Removing one of them fixes the syntax error.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The if statement has a block enclosed in square brackets: `[ a = 1; ]`.
2. After this, there's an `else` followed by a semicolon and another closing bracket `]`.
3. This caused an unexpected ']' because the else clause wasn't properly closed.
4. Removing one of the extra closing brackets fixes the syntax error.

The corrected code removes the trailing square bracket to eliminate the error while maintaining the intended structure.
