Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected '#' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me look at the code they gave:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, so I see that there's an `else` keyword following an `if` statement. In most programming languages, once you have an `if` block closed with `endif` or something similar, you shouldn't use another clause like `else`. That makes sense because the code starts with an `if`, then tries to include an `else`, which isn't allowed.

Looking at the error message, it says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause. The '#' symbol usually represents a comment in many languages, so maybe this is part of some kind of inline comment syntax here. But I'm not sure if that's the case here or just how it's formatted.

Wait, looking closer, the code has `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` followed by `# else b = 2; #`. It seems like they're trying to add an else block but messed up the syntax. Since this is probably part of a language that uses `endif` or similar to close blocks, maybe after the if statement's condition, there should be an `else` clause properly closed with `endif`.

So perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the code so that instead of just having `@ a = 1; # else b = 2;`, it should have an else block. So changing it to:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
else     @ b = 2;
```

This way, after the if statement is closed with `endif` or just by proper syntax, the else can come without any issues.

Alternatively, maybe they're using a different style where comments are placed at the end of lines. So perhaps removing the '#' from before 'else' to make it part of the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

But I'm not entirely sure if that's valid in their specific language, but given the error message about unexpected '#', it seems adding an else without proper syntax is causing the problem. So removing the comment marker before 'else' might fix it.

I think either approach could work, but since the user mentioned using only symbols from the error message (like '#'), maybe replacing the '#' after else with a proper syntax would be better.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
