Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error is a "syntax error," and they want me to use only the provided error message without relying on any pre-trained knowledge. Let's take a look at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that there are some syntax issues here. The code uses angle brackets 《 and 》 which aren't valid in standard Java or C++ syntax. Maybe they're trying to represent something like comments or template tags, but it's not clear.

Looking at the structure, after the if statement, there's an else clause. In Java, the else block should be properly indented and aligned with the if block. The current code has a mix of angle brackets which don't seem right in this context. Also, there are two closing braces at the end: 》 instead of just one.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to use curly braces {} for the if-else statements because those are standard and necessary in Java. So replacing the angle brackets with curly braces might fix it.

Let me rewrite the code accordingly. The corrected code should have an if block followed by an else clause, each enclosed in their own braces. Also, I need to make sure that the indentation is correct so that the else aligns properly under the if statement.

So the fixed code would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That should resolve the syntax error because now the braces are correctly placed and the code structure makes sense. The angle brackets were causing confusion, so replacing them with standard curly braces seems appropriate.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect use of angle brackets and improper formatting for an if-else statement in Java.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace the angle brackets `《` and `》` with standard curly braces `{}` since they are not valid syntax for if statements in these languages.
2. Ensure proper indentation to align the else clause correctly under its corresponding if condition.
3. Remove any trailing or misplaced closing braces to avoid syntax errors.

Fixed code:
```java
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
