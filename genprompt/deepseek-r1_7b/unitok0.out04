Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me see what's going on here. The code given is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay, first off, I notice that there are these fancy brackets—《 and 》—which look like they might be part of some kind of template or markup. But in Python, those aren't valid syntax characters. So probably, the person intended to use regular parentheses but used these instead.

Looking at the structure: if (x >0) then something else. In Python, an if statement should have a colon after the condition, followed by indented blocks for each case. Then the else part should come right after that with its own block.

So breaking it down:

- The initial if is correct: if (x>0)
- But then there's 《 a =1; 》—this seems like an attempt to put code inside the if block, but using 《 and 》 instead of parentheses. So probably should be (a=1)
- Then else b=2—but wait, that's after another 》 which is closing something else. But in Python, each if statement must have its own indented block, so the else needs to directly follow the if, without any extra brackets.

So putting it all together, I think the code should be rewritten with proper parentheses where needed and remove the fancy brackets since they don't serve a purpose here.

Let me try rewriting:

if (x >0):
    a =1
else:
    b=2

Yes, that makes sense. The outer if statement's condition is followed by an indented block for when x>0, then else handles the other case. So removing the 《 and 》 was correct.

I should make sure to format it with proper indentation so Python recognizes the structure correctly.
...done thinking.

The code had incorrect brackets which aren't valid in Python syntax. Replacing them with parentheses fixes the issue.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
