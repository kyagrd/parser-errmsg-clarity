Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, first off, I see an if statement with a condition checking if x is greater than 0. Inside the if block, there's something that looks like "@ a = 1". That doesn't seem right to me because in Python, you can't use @ before a variable like that without some context, maybe as part of a decorator or matrix multiplication? But here it's inside an if statement which is a control flow construct. So using @ there might not be valid syntax.

Then outside the if block, there's "# else b = 2;". Wait, in Python, after an if statement, you have an else clause with indentation. Also, putting # at the beginning of a line usually means it's a comment. So maybe they're trying to add comments here, but the structure is off.

Putting that aside for now, looking at the code again: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #". I think the main issues are two-fold. First, the use of @ inside an if condition isn't valid syntax in Python. Second, the else block is not correctly indented and placed.

So to fix this, I should remove the @ symbol because it's causing a syntax error. Then properly structure the code with indentation so that the else clause is correctly aligned under the if statement.

Let me rewrite it step by step. The corrected code would be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

That way, each block after the if and else statements has proper indentation and comments are removed since they weren't necessary here.
...done thinking.

The original code has syntax errors due to improper use of the @ symbol and incorrect placement of the else clause. Here's the fixed version:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

The corrected code properly indents each block, removes the invalid @ usage, ensuring valid Python syntax.

**Answer:**
```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
