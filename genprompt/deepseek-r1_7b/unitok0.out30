Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and some code. My task is to figure out what's wrong with the code based solely on the error message and then correct it without any additional knowledge beyond that.

First, the error message says "syntax error." That usually means there's something wrong with how the code is structured or written. I remember that syntax errors often involve missing brackets, incorrect semicolons, or mismatched braces. So I should look for those in the provided code.

Looking at the code given:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I can see that there are some strange symbols here: the characters '《' and '》'. These aren't standard brackets or operators in programming. The rest of the code is an if-else statement, which seems correct except for these non-standard delimiters.

The original code starts with `if (x > 0)`, which looks fine. Then there's something inside the if block: `《 a = 1; 》`. That doesn't make sense because 'a = 1;' is an assignment statement, but it's enclosed between these unusual brackets. Similarly, outside the else clause, there's another closing brace with `》`.

I think the problem here is that the developer intended to use standard braces `{}` for the if-else condition but mistakenly used these other symbols instead. The syntax error occurs because the code isn't valid; Python (or whatever language this code is written in) doesn't recognize '《' and '》' as part of control structures.

So, to fix this, I should replace those non-standard brackets with regular curly braces `{}`. That would make the if statement properly structured without causing a syntax error.

The corrected code would look like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This way, each branch of the if-else is correctly enclosed with curly braces, and the syntax error should be resolved.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error in the code, we need to replace the non-standard brackets `《` and `》` with standard curly braces `{}`. The corrected code properly structures the if-else statement.

Here is the fixed code:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
