Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The user mentioned a syntax error: an unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So the code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I see that there are two closing braces here. Let me count them. The if block has one '{' and one '}', then after the else, another '{' starts the next block but doesn't close it properly. Wait, no, in the code provided, after the else, it's just `b = 2; }` without a matching brace for the else block.

So the structure is: if (condition) { ... } else statement ending with a semicolon and then another '}'. That would cause a syntax error because the outer braces aren't balanced. Let me break it down:

- The first part: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }` — this looks okay, one opening brace at the beginning of the if block, and one closing brace after.
- Then comes `else b = 2; }` — here, 'else' is followed by an assignment statement, but then it ends with a '}' which is probably meant to close the outer if's block. But wait, in the code as written, there's already a closing brace at the end of the else statement.

Wait no, looking again: The code after else is `b = 2; }` — so that's one line where it's inside an if-else structure. Wait, but how many braces are there? Let me parse this:

The first part:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }

That's correct: one '{' and one '}'.

Then comes `else b = 2; }` — so the else is followed by an assignment statement, then another brace. So the structure is if (...) { ... } else { ... }, but in this case, the code only has one line inside else: `b=2`, and it's followed by a closing brace.

Wait, no—the way the code is written, after 'else', there's just `b = 2;` without an opening brace. Then another '}' at the end of that statement, which would cause a problem because it might close the outer if block prematurely.

So let me structure this:

Line 1: if (x >0) { a=1; }
Line 2: else b=2; }

The second line ends with } which is outside the else clause. So actually, in code terms, after 'else', we should have an opening brace for any statements inside the else block. Then close that brace before closing the outer if's brace.

So the correct structure would be:

if (x>0) { a=1; }
else {
  b=2;
}

Which translates to adding braces around the else statement.

In the original code, after 'else', there's no opening brace for the else block. So when the code tries to end with another '}', it closes the outer if's block too early because the else is not properly enclosed.

Therefore, to fix this, I need to add an opening brace right after 'else' and then a closing brace before the final one at the end of the line.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, it's written as `else b=2; }` which is missing the braces for the else block. So adding {} around 'b=2' and making sure that there are two closing braces: one after the if block and another after the else block.

Alternatively, perhaps just add an opening brace after else to start a new block, then close it with a matching brace before the final }.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because the code has an extra closing brace without a corresponding opening brace for the else statement. To fix this, we need to properly enclose the else clause within braces.

Here is the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else {
    b = 2;
}
```
