Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem carefully.

The original code is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I remember that 《 and 》 are not standard characters for if-else statements in Python or any common language syntax. They might be placeholders here, but they're causing a syntax error because the code isn't recognized properly.

Looking at the structure, it seems like someone tried to use special characters instead of regular brackets. In most programming languages, including Python, the if statement uses parentheses for conditions and square brackets are used for dictionaries or lists. So replacing them with 《 and 》 is incorrect.

The line starts with 'if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》'. It looks like they intended to write:
- if condition: do something
- else: do another thing

So the correct code should be replacing 《 and 》 with regular parentheses. Also, the extra closing brace at the end is probably a typo or mistake.

Breaking it down:
1. The first part after 'if (x>0)' needs to have an opening parenthesis.
2. Then inside, we have a condition: if true, set a =1; else, set b=2.
3. But in Python, each case should be properly indented within the block.

Wait, actually, the original code seems to mix two statements after 'if (x>0) 《 ... 》'. It's not clear if it's trying to write multiple lines or if there are errors with indentation and syntax.

But perhaps a simpler fix is replacing the 《 and 》 with regular parentheses. So changing 《 a=1; 》 into (a=1;) and similarly for the else part.

So the corrected code would be:
if x > 0: a = 1
else: b = 2

Or, if it's supposed to be on one line without an extra brace, but maybe using proper syntax with colons.

But looking back at the original code, there are two separate lines after 'if (x>0) 《 ... 》 else... So perhaps they intended:

if (x > 0):
    a =1
else:
    b=2

So replacing 《 and 》 with parentheses, adding colons correctly.

Wait, but the original code has an extra closing brace at the end. So that's another error. So I should remove the trailing 》.

Putting it all together:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;

But in Python, the semicolons are used to separate statements on the same line. Alternatively, if they're meant to be on separate lines, colons and indents would apply without semicolons.

Alternatively, maybe it's intended to have expressions inside each condition:

if x>0:
    a=1
else:
    b=2

So that might be another way.

But considering the original code uses 《 and 》 which don't make sense in Python, replacing them with parentheses is necessary. So the corrected code would use regular () instead of 《 》.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error, replace the special characters 《 and 》 with standard parentheses and adjust the structure for proper Python syntax.

The fixed code:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
