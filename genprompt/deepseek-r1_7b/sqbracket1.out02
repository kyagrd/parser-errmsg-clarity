Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided the code:

```fixme
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which suggests that a bracket was used incorrectly. Let me try to understand what's wrong here.

So, in the code, I see `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. It looks like someone tried to add square brackets around some statements. In programming languages like JavaScript or Python, we don't use square brackets for grouping expressions unless using specific syntax that might involve lists.

In the original code, after `if`, there's `[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. The brackets are probably intended to group multiple statements together, but in most programming languages, especially those with block-based scoping like JavaScript or Python (using indentation), you don't use square brackets for that. Instead, you'd use curly braces `{}`.

Wait, looking again, maybe the code is using a different syntax where square brackets are allowed. But more likely, it's just an error because after the first bracket closing `]`, there's another `]` before the else clause, which isn't expected.

So, perhaps the code was intended to have both if and else clauses within square brackets, but that's incorrect. Instead, each condition should be followed by its corresponding block enclosed in curly braces.

Let me break it down:

- The original line after `if (x > 0)` has `[ a = 1; ]`. This is probably an attempt to make the if statement handle multiple expressions, which isn't standard syntax.

- Then comes `else b = 2; ]`, where there's an extra closing bracket that doesn't belong. That's causing the error because after else, it expects another block but instead finds a bracket before the end of line or next statement.

So, to fix this, I think each conditional should have its own block with curly braces. So maybe the code was trying to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But in the original code, it's using square brackets around if and then again at the end after else, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps they intended to use list-like structures but that's not standard. So, removing the square brackets and using curly braces should fix the syntax error.

So, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

This way, each condition has its own block with curly braces, avoiding the extra closing bracket after else.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
