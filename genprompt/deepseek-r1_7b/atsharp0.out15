Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message that says "syntax error" and the code they have is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that in programming languages like C or C++, there's something called the ternary operator which acts as a shorthand for an if-else statement. It uses the syntax condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false. 

Looking at the code, they have "if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #" That doesn't look right. The @ symbol here is probably not correct in this context. Maybe it's supposed to be part of the ternary operator?

Wait, in C or C++, you use "?" instead of "@". So replacing "@" with ":" might fix that. Let me see: if (x > 0) : a =1 ; else b=2 ; That seems better.

But then I notice there are semicolons at the end of each line. In C, each statement should end with a semicolon, but inside the brackets after the ternary operator, do we need them? Actually, in the code structure provided, it's within an if block or maybe just standalone statements. Maybe they're using this as part of a larger program.

Also, the way the code is written might be causing confusion. The original code has lines that are too long and not properly enclosed. So putting each condition on a new line with proper indentation would make it clearer.

So putting it all together, I should replace "@" with ":", add semicolons where needed, and format it correctly using ternary operators with the colon and space for readability.
...done thinking.

The code uses `@` instead of `:` in the ternary operator. It also has improper line breaks and missing semicolons.

```fix
if (x > 0) : a = 1; else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
- The ternary operator requires a colon `:` after the condition.
- Fixed from `@` to `:`.
- Removed extra comment lines as they were not part of the code.
- Added semicolon at the end since it's now a complete statement.
