Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The code provided is:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

First, looking at the code, there's an if-else statement. In JavaScript, when using if statements with else, you need to close both the if and the else part correctly. 

I notice that after the if condition, inside the curly braces `{}`, there's a semicolon `a = 1;`. That seems fine because each statement in a block should end with a semicolon. But then comes the else keyword followed by another semicolon and then another `}` outside.

Wait, so the code is structured as: 

if (condition) { ... } else b = 2;

But without proper braces for the else part. Oh right! In JavaScript, you have to enclose both the if block and the else block within their own curly braces. So the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else {
  b = 2;
}

Looking back at the original code, after the first closing brace `}`, there's an else statement with another semicolon but no opening brace `{`. That would cause a syntax error because the else doesn't have its own block.

So to fix this, I need to add an opening brace after else and close it properly. Let me rewrite that part:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else {
  b = 2;
}

Wait, but in JavaScript, you can also write multiple statements on the same line if they're in braces, but using separate lines is fine too.

So the corrected code should have the else inside its own block with an opening brace right after it. That way, both conditions (x>0 and x<=0) correctly reference their respective blocks.

Let me check again: 

Original code had only one closing brace for if, then else without a block. Adding braces around else's statements fixes it.
...done thinking.

The original code has two issues: incorrect placement of the `else` keyword and improper structure of the conditional statement. The correct syntax requires each branch (`if` and `else`) to have its own curly braces.

**Step-by-step explanation:**
1. **Identify the Problem:** The else statement is outside the closing brace of the if block, leading to a syntax error.
2. **Correct Structure:** Wrap both the if and else branches within their respective curly braces `{}`.

The fixed code:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

**Answer:**
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
