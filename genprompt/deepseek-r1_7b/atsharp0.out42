Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it again. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I remember in programming, especially with languages like C or C++, the ternary operator has specific syntax rules. It should be something like condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false.

Wait, looking at this code, there's an '@' symbol before 'a=1'. That doesn't make sense because the ternary operator isn't '@'. Oh right, maybe it was meant to be a ternary but someone used the wrong operator instead. So replacing '@' with a colon ':' should fix it.

Also, I notice that after the condition and expressions, there are some extra '#' symbols at the end. In C-like languages, the semicolon is used to end statements. Those '#'s aren't needed here because the expressions following them don't have any other code attached, so they're just comments or possibly part of an unrelated line.

Putting it all together, I'll correct '@' to ':' and remove the trailing '#' symbols. That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) : a = 1; else b = 2;
```
