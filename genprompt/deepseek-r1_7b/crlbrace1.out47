Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me look at the code again.

The code provided is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Okay, so I see an if statement followed by an else clause. The issue might be with how the braces are used. Let's break it down.

First, the if condition checks if x is greater than 0. If true, it executes `a=1;` and then closes with a brace `{}`. That looks correct so far.

Then there's an else statement right after without any space before the closing brace of the if block. So, the code inside the else clause starts immediately after the if's closing brace.

Wait, but in the code provided, after the else, there's another `}` which is causing the error. Let me visualize the structure:

- The outermost braces are for the if statement: `{ }`.
- Inside that, we have the if block: `{ a = 1; }`.
- Then outside of that, there's an else clause followed by more code.

But looking at the code again, it ends with `} else b=2; }`. Oh, I see. The structure is messed up because after the else clause, there's another brace which isn't needed.

So, perhaps the user meant to write:
- if condition
- then inside the braces, the if block and else clause correctly placed.
- Then outside of that outermost brace, just have `else b=2;`.

Wait no, in Java or similar languages, you can't have an else without a corresponding if. But here, since it's within the same outer if statement.

So the structure should be:
if (x > 0) { ... } else { ... }

But looking at the original code, after the first brace of the if condition, there are two braces before else and b=2; which is incorrect.

Wait no, in the code provided by the user, it's written as:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So let me count the braces:

- The outer if starts at the first `{`.
- Inside that, after the if block is `}`, so the code inside would be: `a=1; }` which doesn't make sense because it's ending with a closing brace. Wait no, actually, in their code, the line is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So after the if condition and its opening brace `{`, they have `a=1;` on the same line, then another `}` which closes that if block. Then `else b=2;` is outside of this, followed by another `}`.

Wait, no: The code as written has:
- Line 1: if (x >0) { a=1; } else b=2; }
So the structure is:

Line 1: starts with an if statement.
Then inside the first brace, after `a=1;` there's another `}` which closes something. Then comes else followed by `b=2;`, and then another `}`.

Wait no, perhaps it's like this:
The code has two braces in a row. The outer if starts with `{` at line 1, ends at the next `}`, so inside that, we have:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

But then there's another `}` after `else`, which is causing an error.

Wait no, looking again: The code as written is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So the structure is:

- if condition: starts with `{` at line 1.
- Inside that, from `a=1; }` which would end the if block correctly. Wait no, because after `}` in line3 (assuming each line ends there), it's outside.

Wait this is confusing. Let me try to parse it step by step.

Original code:

Line 1: if (x >0) { a =1; }
Then Line2: else b=2;
But wait no, actually, the code as written is all on one line? Or multiple lines?

No, in the user's code, each statement seems to be on separate lines but without proper indentation. The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Wait no, actually, it's all written in one line. Let me check:

Looking at the user's code block, each statement seems to be on separate lines but without indentation because of how they're written.

So perhaps the code is structured as follows:

Line1: if (x>0) { a=1; }
Line2: } else b=2;
Line3: }

But that would mean Line1 starts an if block, which ends at Line1's closing brace. Then Line2 has `else`, which should be inside the same if block, but it's not.

Wait no, perhaps in the code, after the if statement's opening brace, they have the a=1; and then immediately another } before else is written on the next line. That would cause an error because that extra brace is closing something incorrectly.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write:

if (x>0) { a = 1; }
else {
    b = 2;
}

But without proper braces for the else block.

Looking back at the code they provided:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So, perhaps the structure is:

- The if statement starts with `{`.
- Then inside that, after `a=1;` there's another `}` which closes something. But since the if only has one condition, that inner brace might not be correct.

Wait no, in their code, it's written as:
if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So, breaking it down:

- The outermost braces are from `if` to the end of the if statement. So after `if`, we have `{ a=1; }` which is correct.

Then, after that closing brace, there's an `else` and then `b=2;`.

But in Java or similar languages, after the if block ends with its own brace, the else must be at the same level. So perhaps they intended to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } 
else {
    b=2;
}

Which would require braces for the else block.

So the code provided by the user is missing a closing brace after `b=2;` and also has an extra brace at the end which is causing the error.

Wait, in their code, there's only one line with all these statements. So perhaps it's:

Line1: if (x>0) { a =1; } else b=2;
Line2: }

But that would mean after the else statement and `b=2;`, there's another `}` which is causing an error.

So to fix this, we need to properly close all braces. Let me try to write it correctly.

The correct code should be:

if (x>0) { a = 1; }
else {
    b = 2;
}

But the user didn't use braces for the else block, so perhaps that's why there are too many braces.

Looking back at their code: they have an if statement with one brace pair and then an else without a corresponding brace. Then another `}` which is causing the error.

So to fix this, we need to remove the extra closing brace after the else clause.

Let me rewrite the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait no, that would not have braces for the else block. In Java, each if and else must be paired with their own braces correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps they intended to write it without using braces, but that's possible only when there's one statement inside, which is a=1; So:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

Which would work in Java because each if-else clause can have only one statement. But in this case, they're trying to assign a=1 and then else do something.

Wait no, the code has two assignments inside the if block: `a = 1; }` which is not correct syntax because the closing brace should come after all statements inside the if.

But perhaps the user made a mistake by putting a closing brace immediately after a=1;, causing an extra one. So maybe they intended to write:

if (x>0) { 
    a = 1; 
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So, adding braces for each block would fix the syntax error.

Alternatively, if we don't use braces, then it's allowed in Java only when there's one statement. So writing it as:

if (x>0) a=1; else b=2;

But I think using braces is better and less ambiguous.

So to fix the code, perhaps adding the missing brace after `b = 2;` would solve the problem.

Wait no, looking at the user's code again: they have two closing braces. The first one closes the if statement, then another before else causes an error.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2;

Which is valid because after `a=1;` comes }, then else followed by b=2;, but that's not possible without braces. Because in Java, else must be at the same level as if.

Wait no, perhaps they meant to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else {
    b = 2;
}

But since the user didn't include braces for the else block, it's causing an error because of the extra brace after `b=2;`.

So to fix this, we can adjust the code by adding braces where necessary.

The original code is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Which ends with two closing braces: one from the if statement and another at the end. That's causing an error because there's no matching opening brace for that last `}`.

So, perhaps removing the extra `}` would fix it. So:

if (x >0) { a=1; } else b = 2;

But in this case, after the if block is closed by }, then 'else' is at the same level as the if condition, which isn't correct because else must be inside the if's braces.

So actually, to properly structure it, we should have:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

This way, each block has its own brace pair. So in the user's code, they had an extra closing brace at the end, which was causing the syntax error.

So to fix it, we need to add braces for both the if and else blocks.
...done thinking.

The original code has a syntax error due to an unexpected closing brace after the `else` clause. To fix this, we properly enclose each statement within its respective block using braces `{}`.

```java
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The code initially had an `if` condition followed by an `else` without proper brace pairing.
2. An extra closing brace at the end caused the syntax error.
3. By adding braces `{}` around each block, we ensure correct nesting and eliminate the syntax error.

Here's the fixed code inside backticks:

```java
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
