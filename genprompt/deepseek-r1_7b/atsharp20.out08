Thinking...
Alright, I need to figure out how to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there are some characters here that don't make sense together. The line starts with an if statement condition: (x > 0). Then it has '@ a = 1;' followed by '# else...' and another ';' at the end.

I know in many programming languages like C or Java, after an if-else block, you use semicolons to separate statements. But here, there's something before the semicolon that looks odd: '@'. I'm not familiar with this syntax, so maybe it's a typo or incorrect character.

Looking at the error message, it just says "syntax error." So whatever is causing the issue must be related to how these tokens are being used in this context. The '@' symbol doesn't seem right here because in languages like C, the '@' is used for typecasting, but that's not applicable here. 

Then I see the '# else b = 2; #'. In some contexts, '#' could denote comments or indicate a different block, but combining it with 'else' isn't standard syntax. Maybe this line was intended to be part of an if-else statement but is structured incorrectly.

Putting it all together, perhaps the '@' and the '# else' are causing issues. Since I can only use characters that appear in the error message or similar known contexts, maybe replacing '@' with a comma ',' would make sense because in some cases, like in C, you might have (x > 0), a = ... but here it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the '#' is part of a comment. Maybe it was intended to be a continuation line without being an actual statement. So removing or replacing the '#' could help. But if I remove '#', then maybe that would fix the syntax because the previous line had '@' which might have been an operator error.

Wait, another thought: in some languages like C++, you can have compound conditions using logical operators, but here it's written as @ a = 1; which doesn't make sense. Maybe the '@' was supposed to be something else, like '+' or '='?

Alternatively, perhaps the entire line is trying to use some form of assignment within an if statement, but the structure is incorrect.

If I try replacing '@' with a comma ',', it might look better. So instead of @ a = 1;, it would be ,a = 1;. That could potentially fix the syntax error because in C-like languages, you can have multiple statements separated by commas after the if condition.

So putting it all together, maybe the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0), a = 1; else b = 2;

This way, the semicolon separates the two assignment statements correctly. The '@' was replaced with a comma, and the '#' comments were removed because they weren't necessary.

Wait, but in this case, the original code had two separate statements on the same line after the if condition, which isn't valid syntax. So by replacing '@' with a comma and removing the '# else', it fixes the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax issues due to the incorrect use of '@' and '#' symbols alongside an if-else structure. Replacing '@' with a comma ',' separates variable assignments correctly, while removing '#' comments removes unnecessary constructs.

```fix
if (x > 0), a = 1; else b = 2;
```
