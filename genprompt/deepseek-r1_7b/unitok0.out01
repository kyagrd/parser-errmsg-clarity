Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided.

The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, looking at this, I notice that the user mentioned using only the error message and not their pre-trained knowledge. The error message given is just "syntax error." So, I need to figure out where the problem is based on how the code looks.

First, I'll examine the structure of the if statement. Normally, an if statement in a language like C++ or Java would look something like:

if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
   // code
}

In this case, the user's code doesn't have braces around the blocks where they're assigning values to 'a' and 'b'. They used 《 and 》 symbols instead. I think those are being treated as comments or placeholders, but without braces, the syntax is incorrect because each condition should be followed by a block of code enclosed in braces.

So, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

The part after 'if' is using angle brackets which are probably not intended. Instead, it's missing the opening and closing braces for the if-else blocks.

Let me break it down:

- The line starts with an if condition: (x > 0)
- Then there's a comment-looking thing 《 a = 1; 》
- Then else b = 2;
- And another 》 at the end

But this doesn't form proper code blocks. It seems like they intended to have two separate statements inside the if and else, but without braces.

So, I think the correct approach is to replace those angle brackets with actual opening and closing braces for the if block.

Wait, let me count the characters after 'if':

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Breaking it down:

- The first part: if (x > 0)
- Then comes 《 which is likely a placeholder for code
- Then a = 1;
- Then 》, which closes the if block's content but before the else statement.
- Then 'else b=2;' and another 》 at the end.

This suggests that they intended to have an if block with one line of code (a=1) and an else clause with another line (b=2). But in C++, each if-else block must be enclosed within braces {}.

So, the correct syntax should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, both conditions have their respective code blocks properly enclosed with braces. The angle brackets were probably placeholders and not part of the actual code, so removing them and adding the necessary braces would fix the syntax error.

I should make sure that each if statement starts with an opening brace { after 'if', and ends with a closing brace } before 'else'. Then inside the if block, we have our statements. The same goes for the else clause.

So putting it all together, replacing the 《 and 》 with braces should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error because the `if` and `else` statements are not properly enclosed within braces `{}` in C++. Here's the fixed version of the code:

```c++
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The output is: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
