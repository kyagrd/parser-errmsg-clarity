Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's a "syntax error" and provided the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Looking at it, I notice something wrong with the brackets. In programming languages like C or JavaScript, square brackets are used for arrays or objects. Here, they're placed around 'a = 1;' which doesn't make sense in an if statement.

First, the code has "if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]". I see that there's a closing bracket after both conditions, but it seems like only one is needed. The correct structure should be either:

- Using square brackets for an array and checking multiple conditions.
- Or not using brackets if each condition is on its own line.

Since the user probably intended to have two separate conditions, I think removing the extra bracket would fix the syntax error. So, the corrected code should remove the trailing bracket after "a = 1;".

So, changing it from "[ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]" to "else b = 2;" without the closing square brackets.

The final corrected code inside triple backticks would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

I added braces for clarity, but since that's an stylistic choice and wasn't part of the syntax error, it might not be necessary. However, including them makes the code clearer.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
