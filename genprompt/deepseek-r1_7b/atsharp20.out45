Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here with a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, the error message says "syntax error," which means something's wrong with the way the code is structured. I know that in programming, if you have an if statement, after the condition, you usually need to do something—in this case, assign a value.

I notice there are these @ and # symbols at the beginning of each line inside the if block and outside the else clause. In most languages like C or Java, those would be comments, but here they're being used differently. So maybe in this context, they're acting as some kind of syntax markers or delimiters.

Wait, perhaps the @ is a marker that separates code blocks? Like, when using something other than C, you might have different sections for each part. So maybe after the if condition, I should just use a single line to assign the value without any comments in between.

So, the line inside the if block starts with @a = 1; which probably isn't valid syntax. Instead, it should be on its own line or as a separate statement. Since it's part of an if block, maybe I need to structure it properly without the @ and just have the assignment.

Also, the else clause is followed by #, so that comment might mark where the code ends for that else block. So after fixing the if block, the else should be on its own line with a single space before it.

Putting it all together, I think each condition's code should be separated without any @ and # markers. So the fixed code would have each assignment inside its respective if or else clause, without those symbols in between.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax issues because assignments within conditional statements are missing semicolons and proper indentation. Here's how to fix it:

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1;
else b = 2;
```
