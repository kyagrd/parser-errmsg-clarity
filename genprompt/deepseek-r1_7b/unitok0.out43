Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. So the user provided some code with an error message saying "syntax error." The code they have is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, okay, first thing I notice is those weird symbols: 《 and 》. They look similar to angle brackets but aren't standard in programming. In many languages like HTML or CSS, they might represent comments or special syntax, but here it's probably causing a problem.

Looking at the structure of the code, it seems they're trying to write an if-else statement. The correct syntax for an if statement in most languages is:

if (condition) { 
    // code block
} else {
    // another code block
}

But in their code, they have 《 a =1; 》 and then outside of that, else b=2; followed by another 》. It looks like the closing brackets are causing issues because there's an extra one at the end.

So I think the problem is with how they're using these 《 and 》 characters. Instead of using them for comments or something else, maybe they meant to use regular parentheses {} for their if-else statement. So replacing those with standard braces should fix it.

Also, looking at the placement: after the if condition, they have a semicolon before the closing 》, which might be causing another issue. Maybe that's why there's a syntax error because the else block isn't properly closed or something is misplaced.

Putting it all together, replacing the 《 and 》 with standard curly braces { and } should resolve the syntax error. So the corrected code would look like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each block is properly enclosed within braces, and the if-else structure is correctly formatted without any extra brackets or missing semicolons.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
