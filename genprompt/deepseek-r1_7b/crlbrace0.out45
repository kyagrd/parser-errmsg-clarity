Thinking...
Okay, so I have to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I see that there's an opening curly brace after the if statement and then another else block without any condition. Wait, no, actually, looking again, it's if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }. Oh, right, the else is followed by a semicolon instead of another condition.

So the code as written has two issues: one, there's an extra closing curly brace at the end. Let me check that. The first block ends with }, and then the second part starts with else b=2; but it doesn't have a condition because it should be else if or just followed by another block correctly.

Wait, no, in Python, for elif you need to have an expression after else, right? Or is this code actually C-like syntax since there are {} and semicolons. So the error is that the else clause isn't properly connected to a condition.

Looking at the code: if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So, the first block ends with }, then comes else without any condition or expression, which is invalid because in C-like languages, else must be followed by a condition and its corresponding braces. So I think there are two issues here: an extra closing brace at the end and the lack of a condition for else.

Wait, no. Let me count the curly braces. The code has { after if, then inside is } }, which would actually mean that the first block's } is correctly closed, but then another } follows without any corresponding block. So I think the code should not have an extra closing brace at the end.

Also, in C-like syntax, else must be followed by a condition because it has to form an if-else structure with proper blocks. So perhaps the user meant to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But without braces around the else block, that could cause issues too.

Wait, in C-like languages, after else, you can have another condition and its braces. So maybe the code is trying to write an if-else without proper conditions or blocks.

So looking back at the error message: syntax error. Probably because of a missing brace or incorrect placement.

In the given code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I notice that after the first }, there's another } which is not properly closed, and then 'else' without any condition. So I think the correct way would be to close all braces correctly and add an expression for else.

So perhaps the corrected code should remove the extra } at the end and have a proper condition with braces.

Wait, no, let me see: The first if block is {a=1;}, then after that }, but in the original code, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So between the two blocks, there's an extra } at the end. So I think the correct approach is to remove that last }.

Additionally, the else should have its own condition and be properly indented if necessary. But in this case, maybe it was intended for a single-line else without any condition, which isn't valid because else needs a condition.

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript or C, else must be followed by an expression that evaluates to true or false. So perhaps the code is incorrect as written and should have something after else, even if it's empty.

But since the user only wants the fixed code using the error message without prior knowledge, maybe I should just fix the syntax errors based on the provided info.

So looking again:

The first part: if (x > 0) { a = 1; } That seems correct with braces.

Then else b=2; which is wrong because it's missing an expression and closing brace. Also, after the first }, there's another } at the end, making the code have an extra brace.

So I think the solution is to remove the extra } at the end so that the code ends correctly, and then fix the else part by adding a condition with braces if necessary or removing it if not needed.

Wait, but in C-like syntax, you can't have else without a condition. So perhaps the user intended something else. Maybe they meant to write an else clause as part of another control structure, like using elif.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be in Python, where else doesn't require a condition after it if it's part of a multi-line statement, but that's not standard.

Wait no, in Python, you can have just:

if x>0: pass
else:
    pass

But they often use colons and proper indentation. But the original code uses {} instead of colons, so maybe it's another style or language.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a function with else block without braces, but that would not compile correctly because in C-like languages, statements after } must be within blocks unless using single-line syntax.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.

The original code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

First issue: The extra closing brace at the end causes a syntax error because there's no corresponding opening brace after else b=2; So I should remove that last }.

Second issue: The else is followed by b=2; without any condition. In C-like languages, else must have an expression to evaluate before deciding which block to execute. So maybe it's supposed to be:

if (x>0) { a = 1; } else {
    b = 2;
}

But that would require adding braces around the else block.

Alternatively, if we don't add braces, then after else, you can have only one statement in some contexts, but without any condition, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the correct approach is to either fix the else part with a condition or remove it.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and intended for the else block to be on the same line as the if's closing brace. But that wouldn't make sense syntactically.

So considering all these points, I think the main issues are:

1. Extra closing brace at the end of the code.
2. Else statement is missing an expression or a corresponding opening brace.

To fix this, I'll remove the last } so that it's not there anymore. Then, for else to be valid, perhaps add a condition with braces if needed. But since in the original code, after else b=2;}, which suggests that maybe they intended to have no condition but just an assignment, which isn't allowed.

Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement: it's asking only to fix the syntax error based on the given error message without using pre-trained knowledge. So perhaps the user knows that in this context, else needs a condition and a block. Therefore, I need to correct the code by ensuring all braces are properly closed and adding an expression for else.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else {} 

But without any statements inside else's braces, which is allowed in some cases as empty blocks.

So perhaps the solution is to fix the extra brace by removing it and properly closing all braces.
...done thinking.

The code has two main issues: an extra closing curly brace at the end causing a syntax error, and an `else` statement without a corresponding condition or opening brace. To fix this:

1. Remove the extra closing curly brace at the end of the code block.
2. Ensure that each control structure (if, else) is properly closed with its respective opening brace.

Here's the corrected code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
