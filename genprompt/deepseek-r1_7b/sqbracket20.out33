Thinking...
Alright, let's try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. So, the user provided some code with an error message saying there's a syntax issue. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, okay, first, I'll look at the structure of the code. It seems like they're using square brackets, which might be confusing because in many languages, those are used for arrays or maybe something else entirely.

I notice that after the `if` statement, there's `[ a = 1; ]`. That looks a bit off. In most programming languages, when you have an if-else block, each condition has its own set of statements inside curly braces `{}`. So maybe they're trying to use square brackets here where they shouldn't.

Let me break it down line by line. The first part is `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`. Here, the `[` and `]` are probably causing issues because in an if statement, you need to enclose the block with curly braces `{}` instead of square brackets.

Then there's the else clause: `else b = 2; ]`. Again, using a single closing bracket here might be problematic. Wait, actually, it should have its own block. So perhaps they intended to write:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Yes, that makes sense. The original code uses `[` and `]` which are not the correct syntax for enclosing an if-else block in most languages. So replacing those with curly braces `{}` should fix the error.

Also, looking at the semicolons: each statement inside the conditionals needs to end with a semicolon, which they do here, so that's fine.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the brackets and add the curly braces for proper syntax.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
