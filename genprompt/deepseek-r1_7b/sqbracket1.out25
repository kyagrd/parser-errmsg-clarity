Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error is an "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, okay, so the structure starts with an if statement. The condition is (x>0), then there's this array looking thing: [ a = 1; ]. Wait, that doesn't look right because in JavaScript or similar languages, after an if-else block, it shouldn't have another array-like syntax.

Looking closer, I see the code has ] else b=2; followed by another ]. That might be causing the issue. The first ] closes both the condition and the initial array part, but then there's an extra ] that doesn't belong.

So maybe the problem is that after the if block, the code incorrectly starts an else with a bracket or something. Let me think about how to correct this.

In valid syntax, after the if statement, we have two blocks: one for when the condition is true and another for false. The initial part seems like it's trying to define a block where x>0 leads to a=1. But then there's an else that shouldn't be preceded by a bracket.

Perhaps the code was intended to write something like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the given code, it's missing the curly braces and has incorrect brackets. So I need to adjust that.

So replacing the square brackets with curly braces { } for each block should fix the issue. That way, the if statement correctly encapsulates its true case, and the else case does the same without any extra brackets or mismatched ].
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
