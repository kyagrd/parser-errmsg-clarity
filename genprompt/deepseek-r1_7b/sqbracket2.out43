Thinking...
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message and the original code. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, the error message says: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that suggests there's a mismatch with brackets somewhere. I know that in many programming languages, the if-else structure uses curly braces { } to enclose the statements. So maybe the code is using square brackets [ ] instead of curly braces?

Looking at the code provided:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I see that after the if condition, there's a square bracket with a semicolon inside. Then an else statement follows, and another square bracket is closing it with a semicolon.

Wait, so maybe the code should use curly braces instead of square brackets for the if block? Let me think about how this would look corrected.

In many languages like JavaScript or C++, you have { after if, then statements, and } before the end. So perhaps replacing [ ] with { } will fix it.

Let me write that out:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in some languages like C or Java, you can use square brackets for arrays, but within an if statement, the block should be enclosed with curly braces. So I think replacing [ and ] with { and } is the right approach here.

Let me check the syntax again. The original code had a ] after else, which might have been trying to close the if block too early because it was using square brackets instead of curly braces. By changing those, the structure should be correct.

So I'll adjust both instances from [ and ] to { and }. That way, the if statement's block is properly enclosed, and the else doesn't get an extra closing bracket that wasn't needed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
