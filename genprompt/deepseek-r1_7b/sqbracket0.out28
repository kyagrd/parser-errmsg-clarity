Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that there's a syntax error and provided the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

The output needs to be the corrected code inside triple backticks.

First, I'll look at the code line by line. The problematic part is in the if statement condition. It starts with "if (x > 0) [", which seems odd because after the parenthesis, there's a square bracket instead of a colon. Normally, an if statement should have a colon right after the condition.

So the original line is: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]

I think the user intended to write an if-else structure. So maybe they meant to include both conditions inside the braces. But looking at it, there's only one part before the closing brace and another after, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the code, it's written as: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I see now. The syntax is incorrect because inside the square brackets after the condition, there should be an indented block. But here, the user mistakenly placed "a = 1;" right before the closing bracket of the if statement.

So probably, they meant to write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in their code, the braces are missing. They used square brackets instead. So I need to replace those with curly braces {} because that's how Python blocks work.

Looking back at the original code, it seems they tried to use an if statement but messed up the syntax by using [ and ] where they shouldn't have been. Also, after the else keyword, there was another semicolon and a closing bracket which is unnecessary.

So the corrected code should replace the square brackets with curly braces both around the if block and the else block. Let me re-write it properly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
