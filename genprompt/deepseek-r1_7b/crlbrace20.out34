Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I see that there's an if-else statement here. In many programming languages like Java or C++, each control structure must be properly closed with braces on both lines and indented appropriately.

Wait, in this code, after the 'if' block ends with }, then comes the else part without a corresponding opening brace. That's probably causing the syntax error because there's no opening brace for the else statement to match.

So, I should add an opening brace right before the else statement so that both blocks are properly enclosed within braces.

Let me rewrite it:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes, adding the extra opening brace after the else should fix the syntax error because now each block is correctly enclosed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
