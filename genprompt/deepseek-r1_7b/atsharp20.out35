Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here that's giving me a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I'm not familiar with the programming language this is written in, but I can try to figure it out based on common syntax errors.

First, I notice that there are two lines here. The first line ends with a semicolon and has an @ operator before 'a'. Then the second line starts with a # which usually denotes a comment in some languages like C or Python. Maybe this is part of a multi-line if statement?

Wait, in many programming languages, you can't have comments inside conditionals without brackets. So maybe the structure isn't correct.

Looking at the first line: "if (x > 0) @ a = 1;". The @ operator doesn't look familiar to me. Maybe it's supposed to be something else, like an assignment or a function call? Alternatively, perhaps the @ was intended for defining a variable in some way within the if condition.

I remember that sometimes people use @ for anonymous classes or other structures, but without knowing the language, I'm not sure. However, the main issue is probably the syntax error caused by the placement of the # after else and the structure around it.

Wait, the second line starts with a # which in many languages like C would be a comment. But if this code isn't within brackets or some control structure, that might cause an error. Maybe the lines are intended to be part of an if-else block but not enclosed properly.

Another thought: perhaps the @ was supposed to be part of a variable name or function call. Maybe it should be replaced with something else like 'a' as in the first line, making it consistent. So changing @ a = 1; to a=1 might fix the syntax.

Also, I notice that there's an extra # at the end which isn't needed unless it's part of another comment or block. Maybe removing that would help.

Putting it all together, perhaps the code should be adjusted to have proper indentation and structure within the if statement. So rewriting it with correct formatting and removing unnecessary characters:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

That way, each condition is properly handled without syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
