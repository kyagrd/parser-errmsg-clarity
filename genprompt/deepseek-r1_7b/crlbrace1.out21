Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means the if statement isn't closed properly. Let me look at the code again.

The code is:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I see that the if statement starts with "if (x > 0) {" and then has an else clause right after without any indentation or proper structure. The else is followed by "b = 2;" and then there's an extra closing brace at the end.

Wait, so maybe the braces aren't matching. Let me count them. The if statement opens with "{", then inside it is "a = 1;", then the else clause starts with "}" which closes the if block but isn't indented properly. Then after that, there's another "}" at the end.

Oh right! The problem is that the else is part of the same if statement as before, so I should indent it to be inside the if block. But then why is there an extra closing brace? Let me check again.

The code structure should be:
if (condition) {
    // statements
} else {
    // other statements
}

In this case, after the if's opening brace, we have "a = 1;" and then a closing brace which closes the if block. Then, the else is written outside of that, so it starts another block. But in the code provided, the else isn't inside any curly braces yet.

Wait no, actually looking at the code again: after the first "}", which ends the if statement, the next line is "else b = 2;". That should be an error because after the first }, the code continues outside the if block. So to fix it, I need to properly close the else clause.

Wait no, perhaps the code has two separate blocks: one inside the if and another in the else. But looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the first }, which is closing the if statement, there's an else followed by b=2;, then another }. That can't be right because the else should belong to the if, so it needs its own braces.

So I think the correct structure would be:

if (x >0) {
    a =1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

But in the original code, after the first }, there's an else without any {. So that } is closing something incorrectly. Wait no, let me parse it step by step.

The code starts with if (x>0) { ... }. Then inside this block, a =1; is written. Then after that, there's a }, which would close the if statement. But in the original code, right after this }, we have "else b=2;" and then another }.

Wait no, looking again: it's actually like:

if (x >0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So, the first part is if(...) { a=1; }, which ends with }, then comes else ... but without any braces. So that causes an error because after the first }, we're trying to write else as a separate statement outside.

Wait no, actually, in JavaScript (assuming this is JS), each block must be properly enclosed. The else should be inside its own block if needed, so perhaps the code was supposed to have braces for the else clause but didn't add them.

So the error message says there's an unexpected '}' after else. That probably means that the } belongs to something before else, which is incorrect because else isn't part of a block yet.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: In JavaScript, each if statement must have its own closing brace. So in this code:

if (x>0) { a=1; }

That's correct. Then after that, you can't just write "else b=2;" without any braces because else is part of the same if block. But actually, no, else doesn't need to be inside braces unless it has multiple statements.

Wait, in JavaScript, else can follow immediately after if without braces, but when there are multiple statements, you need braces.

So perhaps the original code intended to have the if and else each with their own blocks, like:

if (x>0) {
    a=1;
} else {
    b=2;
}

Which is correct. So in that case, the extra } at the end is unnecessary because after else's block, we don't need another closing brace.

Wait, but looking at the code given: 

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So this has two lines inside if:

Line 1: if statement with { and }
Line 2: else statement without any {
Then line3: another }

But that's incorrect because after the first }, you can't have else as it would be outside the if block. So perhaps the code should instead properly close each block.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that all blocks are correctly closed and indented.

Let me try rewriting the code:

The original has:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

This is incorrect because after the if's }, it continues with else, which should be part of another block. So perhaps the correct approach is to structure each clause with its own braces.

So I'll rewrite the code as:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, both if and else have their own blocks, which fixes the syntax error. Also, removing the extra } at the end is necessary because it's not needed anymore.

So in this case, I need to indent each statement inside its respective block and ensure that all braces are properly closed.
...done thinking.

The code has an improperly placed `else` clause without proper braces. The fix involves adding braces for both the if and else blocks and ensuring correct indentation.

```javascript
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
