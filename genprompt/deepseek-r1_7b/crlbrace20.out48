Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and gave me some specific instructions on how they want the code fixed. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the original code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
I notice that there are two closing curly braces here. The first one after the if statement closes correctly, but then there's another one at the end without any matching opening brace before it. That's probably causing a syntax error because the code isn't properly structured.

So, I need to figure out where each block is supposed to start and end. In an if-else statement, each condition should have its own corresponding block. The original code has only one curly brace after the if, so that covers both the if and else blocks. But then there's a second closing brace at the end which isn't matched.

To fix this, I'll remove the extra closing curly brace at the very end of the code. That way, each statement inside the if is properly enclosed with an opening and closing brace, and the else statement will be correctly associated with the if block without any syntax issues.

So, the corrected code should look like this:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
This removes the extra curly brace at the end, ensuring that each block is properly closed and structured. I think this should resolve the syntax error without any other changes needed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
