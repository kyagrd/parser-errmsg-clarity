Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me take a look at what's provided.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, okay, first off, I notice that there are two closing curly braces `}` here. In programming, each `{` must have a corresponding `}` to close its block or statement. So having an extra one might be causing the issue.

Looking at the if-else structure, it's written as:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
Wait, no, actually in the original code, after the first block there's another `}` before the second closing brace. So that would make three curly braces in total? Let me count: the if statement has `{}`, then the else is followed by a single `}` and then another one at the end.

So the structure should be:
- The if condition opens with `{`
- Then inside, the code block
- The else is part of the same if statement, so it shouldn't have its own block unless specified.
Wait, no. In this case, the code after else is just `b = 2;` without any braces, which might not be an error in terms of syntax but more about style. However, the extra closing brace at the end would definitely cause a problem.

So I think the main issue here is the extra closing curly brace at the very end. The code should only have two: one opening and one closing after the else statement.

Let me reconstruct it step by step:
- The if condition: `if (x > 0) {` opens, then inside has `a = 1;`
- Then the else clause: `else b = 2;` without any braces because it's a single line.
- Finally, close with one more brace.

So combining these correctly should fix the syntax error. I'll remove the extra closing brace at the end to ensure each opening brace has a corresponding one.

Another thing I noticed is that in the else statement, `b = 2;` doesn't have braces because it's just a single line, which is acceptable but might be better with braces for readability. However, since the problem only mentions fixing the syntax error related to the extra brace and not style issues, maybe that's outside the scope.

So putting it all together, I'll adjust the code by removing the last `}` so it becomes:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

That should fix the syntax error because now each brace is correctly matched without any extra closing braces.
...done thinking.

The original code has an extra closing curly brace which causes a syntax error. We need to remove this extra brace.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Identify that there are two closing curly braces at the end, which is incorrect since each opening brace must have a corresponding closing brace.
2. Remove the last `}` so the structure becomes correct with only one closing brace after the else statement.

The fixed code is:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
