Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided the code and an error message, which is "syntax error." My task is to fix the syntax without using any pre-trained knowledge, just based on the error message and the given code.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, I notice that there are some brackets here. The condition in the if statement is `(x > 0)` followed by `[ a = 1; ]`. Then there's an `else` block with `b = 2;` but it's outside another bracket `]`.

Wait, maybe the issue is with how the code is structured. In programming, especially in languages like C or JavaScript, if statements need to be properly formatted with their blocks.

I see that after the if condition, there's a `[`, which might indicate an array or something else. But here, it's used inside the if statement, so perhaps it's meant to define a block. However, the way it's written is causing confusion because the brackets aren't properly closed or nested correctly.

Let me break it down:

1. The code starts with `if (x > 0)`.
2. Then `[ a = 1; ]` — this looks like an array access, but in the context of an if statement, that's not right.
3. Then `else b = 2; ]` — the closing bracket here is at the end, which might be causing a problem because it's after the else statement.

Wait, maybe the user intended to have two separate conditions or perhaps meant to write something else inside the brackets but forgot to close them properly.

Looking again, the code has `[ a = 1; ]` right after the if condition. That seems out of place because an if statement doesn't expect square brackets there unless it's part of an array or some other structure.

Perhaps the user meant to write something like assigning `a` based on the condition and then `b` in the else block, but the brackets are messing up the syntax.

So, the main issue is that the code has mismatched brackets. The first `[` after the if condition doesn't have a corresponding opening bracket before it, making the structure invalid.

Another thing to note is that the closing bracket for the if statement is at the end, which might be causing an extra `]` and messing up the control flow.

So, the corrected code should remove the unnecessary brackets and properly structure the if-else statements. That means removing the `[` after the if condition and ensuring each block is correctly enclosed with `{}` or using proper syntax for expressions if needed.

Wait, but in JavaScript, you can have assignments inside an if statement like `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }`. So maybe that's what the user intended. They just used square brackets instead of curly braces.

Alternatively, if it's for another language where square brackets are part of the syntax, but that seems less likely in this context.

So, the main fix is to replace the `[` and `]` with `{}` around the statements inside each block.

Let me try rewriting the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
 a = 1;
} else {
 b = 2;
}
```
