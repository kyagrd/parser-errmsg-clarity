Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the problem step by step.

The user provided a piece of code with a syntax error and an error message saying there's a syntax issue. The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

First, I notice that this looks like it might be trying to write some conditional statements using operators like @ and #, which don't seem right in standard programming languages. Maybe the user is mixing up different notations or syntax from another language.

Looking at the code, there's an `if` statement: `if (x > 0)`. That part seems correct on its own because it has a condition followed by a semicolon and a colon. But then after that, there's `@ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`.

I remember that in some languages like C or Java, you can't have an assignment inside an if statement without proper syntax. Wait, but the error message just says "syntax error," not specifying where exactly. So I need to check each part.

The `@` symbol is used in certain contexts, maybe like in shell scripting for environment variables? But that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or a misplaced operator.

Looking at the code again, after the if statement, there's an `@ a = 1;` which doesn't make sense because you can't assign a value to a variable using `=` inside an expression like that with `@`. Also, the `#` symbols are usually used for comments. So maybe those are causing issues.

Wait, perhaps the code is intended to be in a different language where `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;` is trying to write something like setting variables based on conditions, but using incorrect syntax.

Another thought: in some languages, you can use logical operators, but here it's mixing `@` and `#`. Maybe the user intended to use semicolons correctly but messed up the symbols.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be written with proper line breaks or indentation. But looking at the provided code, each statement is on a new line with semicolons, which might not be an issue itself unless there's something wrong with the operators.

Wait, another possibility: maybe `@` is part of a different syntax, like in mathematical expressions where it could denote something else, but that seems unlikely here.

So focusing on the `#` symbols. In many languages, especially those that support comments, lines starting with `#` are ignored. So if these lines are meant to be part of an if-else statement, they should probably not be there as comments.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

This seems like two separate statements: one being `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` and another with `else b = 2;`, but that's not valid syntax because the else is part of an if-else construct.

Wait, maybe the code was supposed to be:

```
if (x > 0)
    @ a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
```

But without proper indentation or line breaks. However, in many languages, you need to have each statement on its own line or at least properly separated.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is using some custom syntax where `@` and `#` are operators that aren't standard. For example, in shell scripting, `>` can be used for redirection, but here it's `@` which doesn't ring a bell.

Another angle: Maybe this is intended to be JavaScript or another language where you can use ternary operators, but the code uses if-else instead, which isn't compatible with JavaScript syntax.

Wait, in some languages like Prolog, there are different constructs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps `@` is part of a different operator set, like in C for preprocessor directives or in Ruby for symbols before block statements.

But given the context, it's more likely that the code was intended to be written with proper if-else structure but has misplaced operators and comments.

So putting this all together, the main issues are:

1. The use of `@` after the condition is incorrect.
2. The presence of `#` as comment markers is causing confusion because they're placed on separate lines which might not be intended.
3. The else statement isn't properly aligned with its corresponding if.

So to fix this, I need to remove the comments (the lines starting with `#`) and correctly structure the if-else block with proper indentation or line breaks so that each statement is a complete expression.

The corrected code should be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    @a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But wait, in some languages like JavaScript, for example, you can't use `@` before variable assignment. So maybe the user meant to assign a value using an operator that's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a custom syntax or another language where `@` and `#` have specific meanings. But without more context, I'll assume it's supposed to be in a standard language like C or Java.

So removing the comments and aligning the else clause properly should fix the syntax.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @a = 1; else b = 2;
```
