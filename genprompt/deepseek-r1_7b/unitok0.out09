Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message is just "syntax error," so I don't have much information beyond that. Let me look at the code provided:

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, looking at this line, it seems like there are some issues with punctuation and formatting. The characters '《' and '》' look like they might be Chinese punctuation marks instead of the standard '<' and '>' symbols.

First, I notice that after the condition `(x > 0)`, there's a space before the parenthesis `）`. Wait, no, actually, in the code, it's written as `(x > 0)` but then has some other characters. Let me parse this again.

Breaking it down:
- The line starts with `if (x > 0)`
- Then there are these characters: `《 a = 1; 》`
- Followed by `else b = 2;`

Wait, the code seems to have extra space and then those angle-like characters. Maybe they're not supposed to be there. Perhaps it's using Chinese angle brackets or something else.

So, perhaps the original intention was to use standard '<' and '>' for the if statement. Let me rewrite that part without the 《》.

Also, looking at the structure: after the if condition, in an else statement, only one block is needed. In the code, it's written as `《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2;` which might not parse correctly because of the misplaced } and comma.

Wait, perhaps the correct syntax should be using {} for blocks inside if-else. So maybe instead of using angle brackets, we should use curly braces.

So putting it all together:

The corrected code would replace the 《》 with {}, and fix any misplaced commas or spaces.

Let me write it step by step:
1. Remove the extra space after `(x > 0)`.
2. Replace `《 a = 1; 》` with `{ a = 1; }`.
3. Ensure that only one block is present inside if-else.

So the corrected code should look like:

```
if (x > 0)
{
    a = 1;
}
else
{
    b = 2;
}
```

I think that's it. The main issues were using non-standard punctuation and incorrect block formatting.
...done thinking.

The error is due to incorrect use of angle-like characters instead of standard '<' and '>' brackets, as well as improper indentation. The corrected code uses curly braces `{}` for the if-else blocks.

```fix
if (x > 0)
{
    a = 1;
}
else
{
    b = 2;
}
```
