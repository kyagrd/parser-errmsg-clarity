Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at what's provided. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

And the error message says there's a syntax error. Hmm, I remember that in programming, especially in languages like C or JavaScript, comments are important for explaining code, but sometimes they can cause issues if not used correctly.

Looking at the code, I see an `if` statement followed by something that looks like a comment starting with `@`, then another comment starting with `#`. Wait, no, actually in some languages, the `//` is used for single-line comments. So maybe the `@` here is causing confusion because it's not part of a comment.

I recall that in JavaScript, the correct way to write a single-line comment is with `//`, and multiline comments are done with `/* */`. The `@` symbol isn't valid on its own; perhaps it was intended as a comment but written incorrectly. So instead of using `@`, which might be causing confusion or being an error, I should change it to the correct comment syntax.

Also, after the `if` statement, there's another line with `else b = 2; #`. That seems like another comment. But if that's intended as code, perhaps just removing the comments would fix the issue because having a line of code followed by a comment without any operator can cause confusion or syntax errors.

So putting it all together, maybe the original code was trying to write an `if` statement and then have some else condition, but the use of `@` as a comment was incorrect. So replacing `@` with `//` in that line might fix the syntax error.

Wait, actually looking again: The first line after `if (x > 0)` is `@ a = 1; #`. Since comments start with `//`, perhaps they meant to use `//` but instead used `@` which isn't valid. So maybe just removing that line or correcting it would help.

Alternatively, if the code was supposed to be within an else clause, perhaps there's more context missing. But based on the error and what's provided, I think replacing the `@` with a comment marker is necessary.

So the fixed code should have the `if (x > 0)` line without any invalid syntax after it. So removing the `@ a = 1; #` part would make sense because having a line that doesn't end properly can cause a syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has an issue with how comments are written, specifically using the incorrect symbol `@` instead of `//`. Additionally, the trailing comment after the else statement causes confusion. Removing the erroneous parts will fix the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0)
else b = 2;
```

The fixed code removes the invalid part with `@`, resulting in a properly structured if-else statement without any comments or trailing code issues.
