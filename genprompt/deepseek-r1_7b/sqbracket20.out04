Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code snippet. The user provided an error message: "syntax error." So, my first step is to look at the code and figure out where the problem might be.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I notice that there's an if statement with an else clause. The structure seems off because the brackets are mismatched. In many programming languages like C or Java, square brackets are used for arrays or function calls, but here they're inside an if condition.

Wait, in some languages, especially those with block-based syntax, sometimes you can use braces {} instead of brackets []. But even then, the structure needs to be correct. Let me check each part.

The code starts with if (x > 0), which is fine. Then there's a [, followed by a semicolon, and then another ] after else. That doesn't look right because in an if-else statement, each block should be properly enclosed within braces or brackets, depending on the language.

In this case, it looks like the code might be trying to write two separate statements inside the if condition without proper syntax. The first part is [ a = 1; ], which seems like a misplaced assignment. Then after else, there's b = 2; but that's outside any block because of the extra ].

So, I think the issue is that the code isn't properly structured. It should have braces or brackets for each condition branch. Since in many languages, using square brackets here might not be correct unless they're part of an array or list.

Looking back at how if statements are usually written:

if (condition) { statement1; } else { statement2; }

But the code uses [ and ] instead. So maybe it's trying to use them as braces but isn't closing them properly.

In the original code, after the if condition, there's a [ which probably starts a block, then inside that block, an assignment a = 1;, followed by another ] which might be intended for the else part. But then, outside of that, it has else b = 2; with an extra ] at the end.

So the structure is incorrect because the blocks aren't properly nested or closed. The correct way would be to have each condition branch enclosed within braces {} if using a block-based language, but since this code uses [ and ], perhaps they intended to use them as part of the syntax, which might not be allowed in all contexts.

Wait, maybe it's trying to write something like JavaScript where you can assign variables inside conditions. But that doesn't make sense because you can't have assignments within an if condition without proper blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps this code is from a language that uses square brackets for function calls or arrays, but the syntax is wrong here because they're not part of a valid expression in this context.

So to fix it, I need to adjust the syntax. The correct approach would be to remove the mismatched brackets and use proper braces {} instead, as most programming languages require.

Let me rewrite the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each condition has its own block enclosed in braces. This should resolve the syntax error because now each statement is properly associated with its respective if or else clause.
...done thinking.

The original code uses mismatched square brackets which aren't valid syntax for an `if-else` structure. Proper braces `{}` are used instead to correctly define the blocks.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Mismatched Brackets**: The original code uses `[` and `]` which aren't appropriate for defining if-else blocks.
2. **Use Correct Syntax for Blocks**: Replace mismatched brackets with braces `{}` to properly enclose each condition's statements.
3. **Adjust Code Structure**: Ensure the syntax follows standard block definitions, resulting in a correct and syntactically valid structure.

The fixed code now correctly defines two separate blocks under the `if` and `else` conditions using braces.
