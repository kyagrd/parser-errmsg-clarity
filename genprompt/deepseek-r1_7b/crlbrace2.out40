Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means a closing brace is misplaced or missing. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, I notice that there are two closing braces here. The first part after if has one '}', but then another one comes right after else, which is causing the issue.

Wait, so the structure should be an if statement followed by an else, each with their own braces. But in the code, after the if condition, there's a single brace, and then another brace for else. That's probably wrong because the else isn't connected to the first if properly.

So I think the correct syntax should have each clause (if and else) enclosed within its own set of braces. The original code has only one brace after if, but then it closes again before else, which is incorrect.

Let me break it down:

- If x > 0: { a = 1; } — that's fine.
- Then an else without any condition: else b = 2; — this isn't correct because else should be part of an if statement and must have its own braces or be connected with an if-else structure.

Wait, maybe the code was supposed to have an else if? Or perhaps it's intended to have separate conditions. Alternatively, maybe the else is meant to go with a different if condition, but in this case, it's just written incorrectly.

But looking at the error message again: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So after the else, there's another }, which isn't needed because the else should be part of an if block. 

Wait, perhaps the code was meant to have two separate if-else statements? Or maybe it's a typo and the else is supposed to be part of the same if condition but on a new line.

Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to write something like:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else if (x < 0) { b=2; }

But in that case, it's two conditions. But the original code only has one else clause without an else if.

Wait, but in any case, the error is about having an extra brace after else. So I think the issue is that there are two closing braces: one after the if condition and another after else, which isn't correct because else should be within a single block or have its own condition with braces.

So to fix this, I need to make sure that only one } is present where needed. Let me count the braces:

The original code has:
if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

That's two closing braces: one after if and another at the end. So the first brace closes the if statement, but then there's an else without any condition, which is invalid because else must be part of an if-else structure.

Wait, perhaps the code was intended to have only a single if block with an else inside it? But that doesn't make sense in standard syntax.

Alternatively, maybe the else should not have its own brace but just be at the same level as the if. Wait, no, because else is part of the if statement and needs to be within braces or connected properly.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But that would add an extra brace after else, which might not have been intended. Alternatively, maybe the original code should not have two closing braces at all.

Looking back, the user provided the error message: unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed). So it's because there are too many braces. The first } closes the if block, and then another } comes after else, which is unnecessary.

So to fix this, I need to remove the extra brace at the end. Let me rewrite the code without that.

The corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

But wait, in some languages like C or Java, else doesn't require braces if it's just one statement, but in this case, perhaps the original code is from a different context where braces are mandatory for every block.

Alternatively, maybe each line after if and else needs to be indented properly. Wait, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

I think the issue is that there's an extra } at the end, causing the unexpected syntax error. So removing that last } should fix it.

Alternatively, maybe the else was meant to be on its own line with braces, but in this case, since both if and else have their own braces, perhaps the code is supposed to have:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But that would require two closing braces: one for the if and another for the else. But wait, no, because in standard syntax, you can't have an else without a corresponding condition unless it's part of an if-else if structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was intended to be:

if (x > 0) { a=1; } else { b=2; }

But that would require two braces: one after if and another after else. So the original code had only one brace after if and then another at the end, which is wrong.

So to fix it, I should remove the extra brace at the end so that there's only one }, closing both the if and else properly.

Wait, no, because each block (if and else) would require their own braces. So perhaps the correct code is:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

Which has two brace pairs: one for if and another for else, totaling four braces, but that's not necessary if it's a single-line statement.

Alternatively, maybe each statement inside the if and else can be on its own line without braces. For example:

if (x > 0)
    a =1;
else
    b=2;

But in that case, there are no extra braces, so perhaps the original code was written with braces unnecessarily but had an extra one at the end.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that each if and else statement has its own brace. So:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But that would have two closing braces: one after if and another after else, but in code, it's written as:

if (...) {
a=1;
} else {
b=2;
}

Which is correct. So the original code had only one brace at the end of the if statement, then an else without a block, which was invalid.

Wait, no, looking again: the code was:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So that's after else there's another }, making it two braces. So to fix this, I need to remove the extra brace at the end.

But wait, is that correct? Let me check: in the code, after else b=2;, there's a closing brace and then an ending brace for the entire code?

No, actually, no. The code as written has:

Line 1: if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So line 3 is just }, which closes the if statement on line 1. Then after that, line 4 is another }, which would try to close something else, but there's nothing open yet except the initial if.

Hence, the parser sees an unexpected brace at the end of else.

Therefore, to fix this, I should remove the last } so that the code ends correctly.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

But wait, in some languages, you don't need braces for single statements. So perhaps the original code was intended to have each statement on its own line with proper indentation and without an extra brace.

Alternatively, if the code is from a language that requires braces around each clause, then maybe both clauses should have their own braces:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But in this case, it's two closing braces: one after if and another after else. So perhaps the original code had an extra brace at the end.

So to fix it, I can remove the last }, making it:

if (x > 0) { a =1; } else b=2;

Which would close both blocks correctly.
...done thinking.

The error is due to an extra closing brace after the else statement. Removing this brace fixes the syntax.

```code
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
