Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. So, the user provided an error message and the faulty code. The error says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which is already closed. Hmm, okay, so first I need to understand where the problem is.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I notice that there are these symbols '《' and '》' around the statements inside the if and else clauses. That's probably not standard syntax in Python, so they might be causing issues.

In Python, we typically use parentheses for function calls or conditions but also curly braces {} for dictionaries or control structures like loops and conditionals when using something like a comprehension or maybe a lambda? Wait, no, in this case, it's inside an if statement. So perhaps the user intended to use parentheses for grouping instead of these custom symbols.

So, the first line after the if statement is 《 a = 1; 》 which probably should be (a = 1). Similarly, the else clause ends with } but there's an extra '》' at the end. That must be causing the syntax error because Python expects only one closing brace for each opening.

Let me break it down:

Original code:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

The part after if is using '《' and '》' which are not valid in this context. So I'll replace them with parentheses to fix the grouping.

So changing it to:

if (x > 0): (a = 1)
else: (b = 2)

Wait, but looking at the code again, there's a semicolon inside each statement and an extra closing brace after else. So in the corrected version, I should remove those custom braces and replace them with regular ones.

So putting it all together:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

This way, everything is properly indented and uses correct syntax without any extra characters like '》'. The semicolons are fine in Python as long as each statement is on its own line within the same block.

I think that should fix the unexpected character error. Let me double-check: after replacing, the code now has proper indentation, correct parentheses for grouping, and only one closing brace per if-else structure. Yes, that makes sense.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

The original code had two issues: it used custom characters '《' and '》' instead of parentheses for grouping expressions, and there was an extra closing brace at the end. The fixed version uses standard parentheses with proper indentation to match Python's syntax requirements.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replaced `《` and `》` after if/else keywords with regular parentheses `( )`.
2. Fixed the trailing `》` which was not needed.
3. Ensured each statement is properly indented on its own line within the control structures.
