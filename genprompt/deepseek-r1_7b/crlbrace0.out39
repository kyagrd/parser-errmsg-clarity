Thinking...
Okay, so I have to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and provided the code along with an output example where they just wrote the corrected code inside triple backticks. But now they want me to think through how I would approach solving this problem.

First, looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

I notice that there are some issues here. Let's break it down.

The main structure is an if-else statement. The syntax for if-else in programming typically has three parts: the condition, the block for true, and the block for false. Each block is enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

Looking at the code:
- The first part checks if `x > 0`, which makes sense.
- Then there's an opening brace `{` followed by `a = 1; } else`. Wait, that doesn't look right because after `{ a = 1; }`, they have `else b = 2; }`.

Hmm, so the structure is off. The if statement should be properly formatted with the condition and then two blocks: one for when the condition is true and another for when it's false.

So in this code, after the opening brace of the if block `{ a = 1; }`, they have an else statement immediately following without any space or proper structure. That's incorrect because the else should be on the same level as the main if, not inside the if block.

Also, at the end, there's another `}` which is causing a syntax error because it doesn't properly close the else block.

Let me visualize how this code is structured:

1. The if statement starts with `(x > 0) {`.
2. Then inside the braces: `a = 1; }`—but wait, that's not right. Because after `{`, you can't have another `}` immediately without a statement in between.

Wait, actually, looking more carefully:

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So the if block has `{ a = 1; }` and then outside of that, but within the same level as the if statement's braces, there's `else b = 2;}`. So actually, it's trying to close another brace at the end.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

- `if (x >0) { a=1; } else b=2; }`

So after the else block, there's an extra `}`, which is causing a problem because the code is ending with an extra closing brace. But also, inside the if statement, they have `{ a = 1; }`, but that's not correct either.

Because when you have an if statement in code, it should be structured as:

if (condition) { ... }
else { ... }

So each block must be properly enclosed within its own braces and separated by else/elseif.

In the given code, inside the first if block, there's `{ a = 1; }`, which is wrong because that would mean after closing the if's brace with `}`, it immediately has another `}` for something else. But in this case, it's not properly structured.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that they have an extra `else` statement without braces around it? Or maybe the code isn't correctly indented or structured.

Looking again:

The user provided:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

So after `{ a=1; }`, they have an `else` statement without any braces. That's incorrect because the else should be inside its own braces.

Also, at the end of the code, there's another closing brace from `}` which doesn't match properly. Let me count the braces:

- The if starts with `{`.
- Then after that, they have a line ending with `else b=2; }`.

Wait, so between `{` and the next `}`, it's trying to include an else statement without any braces, but then at the end of the code, there's another `}` which is causing a syntax error because it doesn't close properly.

So perhaps the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each statement inside the if and else blocks has their own braces. Also, there's no extra `}` at the end because the code ends after the else block.

So to fix the given code:

- Remove the empty line between `{ a=1; }` and `else`.
- Properly add braces for the else part.
- Ensure that each brace is correctly matched without any trailing or missing ones.

Thus, the corrected code should have both if and else blocks properly enclosed with their own braces. Also, the extra `}` at the end of the user's code was causing a syntax error because there wasn't anything to close after the else statement except an extra brace that didn't match.
...done thinking.

The original code has two main issues: improper structure within the if-else block and an extra closing brace causing a syntax error. To fix this, each block (if and else) should be enclosed in its own set of braces, properly aligned without any trailing or missing braces.

Here is the corrected code:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
