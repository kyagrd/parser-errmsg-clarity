Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error" and the code that's supposed to be corrected is:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

I remember from my programming classes that syntax errors usually occur when the structure of the code isn't correct according to the language's rules. In this case, it's probably an issue with how the if-else statement is written.

Looking at the code, I notice a few things. First, after the if block, there's a closing brace '}' which ends the first condition. Then, outside of that, there's an else statement followed by 'b = 2; }'. Wait, but in an if-else structure, each branch needs to be properly enclosed within braces.

In many programming languages like JavaScript or Python, you have to make sure that each block is correctly indented and closed. Here, the code seems to be missing a closing brace before the else statement. Also, after the else keyword, it's trying to assign a value to 'b' but without proper curly braces enclosing that part.

So, I think the problem is that there are two separate blocks: one for when x > 0 and another for the else case, but they're not properly enclosed with their own braces. Without braces around the else block, the code might be executing statements outside of it incorrectly, or maybe the compiler/interpreter isn't treating them as a single statement.

To fix this, I should add the missing curly brace after the else keyword to close its block. That way, both the if and else parts have their own blocks properly enclosed. So the corrected code would look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each condition is correctly separated into its own block with braces, which should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has an improper structure for an if-else statement. The `else` clause wasn't properly closed with curly braces before assigning `b=2`. By adding a closing brace after `else`, we ensure that each condition is correctly enclosed.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
