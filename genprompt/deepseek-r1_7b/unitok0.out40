Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's see what the original code looks like:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first off, I notice that there are these fancy brackets called 《 and 》 which aren't standard in programming languages. In C-like syntax or maybe some custom scripts, they might be used for comments or something else, but in Python, we don't use them. So the code is probably meant to be a normal if-else statement.

Looking at the structure, it seems like someone tried to write an if condition and then an else clause using these 《 and 》 symbols. But that's not valid Python syntax. In Python, you just use parentheses for conditions.

So the first part is "if (x > 0) ". That looks correct except maybe for the spaces around the parenthesis, but in Python, it's usually okay to have spaces. The main issue seems to be with the else statement.

Then there's this line: "else b = 2;". But looking at how it's structured, after the if block, they're trying to close it with another 》. That doesn't make sense because each if-else should be on a new line and properly indented.

Wait, actually, in Python, an else clause must come directly after the if statement without any additional lines unless you have multi-line conditions, like using colons and tabs for indentation.

So maybe the structure is trying to do something different. The original code has both 《 and } which are probably causing syntax errors because they're not recognized as part of the control structures in Python.

Putting it all together, I think the intended code was supposed to be a simple if-else statement without those fancy brackets. So replacing the 《 with ( and 》 with ) would fix that issue.

Wait no, looking closer, maybe the user used 《 for opening and closing comments or something else entirely. But since Python doesn't recognize them as such, they're causing syntax errors.

So to fix it, I can replace those brackets with standard parentheses. Let me rewrite the code:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

That should work because each if-else block is properly indented and ends with a semicolon correctly. The braces were probably meant to be parentheses, so removing them fixes the syntax.

So in summary, the main mistake was using non-standard brackets instead of regular ones, and not properly indenting the else clause.
...done thinking.

To fix the code, replace the 《 and 》 brackets with standard parentheses and ensure proper indentation for the if-else structure.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Remove the non-standard 《 and 》 brackets.
2. Indent the inner code blocks under each condition (if and else).
3. Ensure correct use of colons, indents, and semicolons.

The fixed code is:

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

Only the if-else structure needed fixing with proper syntax.

Fixed code inside triple backticks:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
