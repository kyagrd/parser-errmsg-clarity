Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing an error. The user provided the error message and the code. Let me try to figure out what's wrong.

Looking at the code: if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice there are these symbols 《 and 》 around the statements. Maybe they're supposed to represent something like comments or maybe tags? But in Python, you don't use those angle brackets for anything. Oh wait, perhaps they're meant to be curly braces or some other syntax.

Wait, looking at the error message: it says there's an unexpected '》' after else clause. So somewhere, the code is closing a block too early or not properly opening one.

In Python, you use indentation and colons for if statements. The given code has if (x>0) with some 《 around a=1; then an else with b=2;. But where are the parentheses? Oh right, in Python, after the colon of the if statement, you need to indent until the closing parenthesis.

In the code, I see that inside the if block, it's written as 《a =1;》. That probably shouldn't be there because a=1 is part of the if condition. Then the else clause starts with else b=2;, but also ends with 》 which might not be correct.

So maybe the 《 and 》 are not needed at all, or perhaps they were meant to represent something like comments? Or maybe it's just incorrect syntax because those symbols aren't recognized as anything in Python.

The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after else clause. So perhaps the code is trying to close a block that isn't opened properly. Let me count the brackets or angle brackets.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0)《a =1;》 else b=2;

Wait, in Python, you don't use angle brackets for anything, so those should be removed. The if statement structure is: if condition: ... else: ...

So I think the correct code would have the if block indented and ending with a colon, then the else clause properly indented as well.

Let me rewrite it:

if (x > 0):
    a =1
else:
    b=2

Yes, that makes sense. So removing the angle brackets and adjusting the indentation should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
