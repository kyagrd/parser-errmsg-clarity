Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. Let me look at it again.

The code is: `if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`

Hmm, I remember that in Python, we use colons for if statements, and indentation matters. The problem here seems to be the special characters used instead of parentheses or brackets.

The code uses 《 and 》 which are not valid syntax in Python. So maybe those should be replaced with something else. Wait, since it's an if statement followed by an else, perhaps using normal parentheses would fix it.

So I'll replace 《 with ( and 》 with ). That gives me: `if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;`

Let me check that again. The if condition is correctly enclosed in parentheses, and the statements under each condition are properly indented. The semicolons are also in the right places.

So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But since the user wants it within triple backticks without extra lines, I'll format it accordingly.
...done thinking.

The syntax error arises because 《 and 》 are not valid Python keywords. Replacing them with parentheses fixes the issue.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Invalid Characters**: Recognize that 《 and 》 are not recognized in Python syntax.
2. **Replace Parentheses**: Substitute 《 with '(' and 》 with ')'.
3. **Adjust Indentation and Structure**: Ensure proper indentation for the if-else block structure within a single line where necessary, though in this case, using semicolons allows it to be on one line.

The fixed code is now syntactically correct.
