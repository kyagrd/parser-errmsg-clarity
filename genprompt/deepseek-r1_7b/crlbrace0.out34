Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's a syntax error, so something is wrong with the code structure or statements.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
I notice that after the `else` statement, there's an assignment `b = 2;`, but it's not inside any if block. The closing brace for the if-else statement is only covering the first part.

So, probably, the code has a missing brace or incorrect indentation causing it to close improperly. Alternatively, maybe the lines are split incorrectly.

I think the problem is that the else statement isn't properly paired with its condition. In this case, since both branches should have blocks enclosed within their respective braces, I need to ensure each block is correctly closed.

To fix this, I'll check if all opening braces have corresponding closing braces and adjust accordingly. In the given code, after `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;`, there's an extra closing brace at the end which might be causing the issue.

So, removing the trailing closing brace should resolve the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
