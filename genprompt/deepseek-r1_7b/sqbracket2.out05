Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause of an if statement, which means the if statement already closed. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I notice that the if statement is followed by brackets and then an else statement. The error mentions an unexpected ']' after the else clause. So maybe there's an extra bracket somewhere.

Looking closer, the code has (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]. Wait, after the if condition, it's using square brackets instead of parentheses or curly braces. But in many languages, like JavaScript, you use {} for objects or conditions. However, here the user mentioned that the syntax might be different from C, Java, Python, etc., so maybe they're using a different structure.

In this code, after (x > 0), there's [ a = 1; ] else... So perhaps the brackets are part of an array or something. But then the else is outside, which might not make sense if it's expecting only one statement in each arm of the condition.

Wait, but the error says that after the else clause (which is already closed), there's another ']', so maybe the closing bracket for the initial [ ] was extra and should be removed. Let me check: the code has two brackets at the end: ] else b = 2; ]. So perhaps the outermost ] is causing the issue.

So to fix this, I can remove that last ]. The corrected line would then only have one closing bracket for the if statement's condition.

So the fixed code should be:

if (x > 0)[ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

Wait, but in some languages like JavaScript, you might need to use {} around statements. However, since the user mentioned that the syntax is different from common languages, maybe it's acceptable here without those braces.

So I think removing the extra ']' at the end should fix the issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)[ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
