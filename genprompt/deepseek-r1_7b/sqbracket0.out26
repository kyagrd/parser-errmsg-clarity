Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided: 

`if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`

Hmm, okay, first off, I notice that the code uses square brackets `[ ]` instead of parentheses for what looks like conditional statements. In many programming languages, like C or JavaScript, you use parentheses `()` for conditions and sometimes brackets for array literals. But here, it seems like someone might have accidentally used square brackets where they shouldn't.

Looking closer, after `(x > 0)`, there's a `[` which is followed by `a = 1; ]`. Wait, that doesn't look right. The code structure should be something like an if-else statement with curly braces `{}` for the block of code when the condition is true and another block when false.

So in this case, maybe it's supposed to be an if-else construct using parentheses but perhaps using curly braces instead? Or maybe square brackets were intended as part of a different structure, like an array or something else. But given that the user mentioned using only the error message without prior knowledge, I should focus solely on what's presented.

The error message is "syntax error," which suggests there's a problem with how the code is structured. Let me analyze each part step by step.

First part: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ]`

Here, after the condition `(x > 0)`, an open square bracket `[` is used. But in most programming languages, you don't use brackets immediately after an if statement for simple conditions. Instead, it's either parentheses or curly braces.

Wait, actually, maybe this is part of a switch-case structure? Switch uses parentheses for cases and brackets can be used to group multiple case statements, but that's not common practice. Alternatively, perhaps the square brackets are intended for something else, like an array initializer or a list comprehension, but in this context, it doesn't fit.

Looking at the next part: `else b = 2; ]`. So after the if condition and its block, there's an else statement followed by another semicolon and a closing bracket. That seems off because else should also be enclosed within curly braces or parentheses, depending on the language.

Putting it all together, the code is trying to define something that looks like an if-else conditional but is using square brackets instead of the correct syntax for its intended structure.

So, let's think about how to fix this. The most straightforward way is to change the square brackets to either parentheses or curly braces, depending on what was intended.

But wait, in JavaScript, for example, you have:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Which uses curly braces `{}` for the blocks. So perhaps replacing the square brackets with curly braces would fix the syntax error.

Alternatively, if it's meant to be an array or something similar, but that seems less likely given the structure. However, since the code has `if` and `else`, which are control structures, using curly braces is more appropriate than square brackets.

So, I think changing `[ ]` to `{ }` would fix the syntax error because it's a common mistake to mix up different types of brackets in conditional statements.

Another thing to note: The original code ends with `] else b = 2; ]`, which has two closing brackets. That's incorrect because each control structure block should be enclosed within its own set of curly braces or parentheses, not square brackets and also having an extra one at the end.

Therefore, replacing all square brackets with curly braces would resolve the syntax issue.
...done thinking.

The original code incorrectly uses square brackets for an if-else statement. By switching to curly braces, the syntax error is resolved.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
