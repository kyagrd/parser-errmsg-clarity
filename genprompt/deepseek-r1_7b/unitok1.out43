Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code and the error message to understand what's wrong.

The original code is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I remember that when using curly braces `{}` with if statements, they must be properly placed. The error says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Hmm, it seems like a typo.

Looking at the code, I see "《" and "》" around parts of the code. These might be intended to wrap lines inside the condition but are causing issues because they aren't matching or properly placed.

First, in the if statement, "(x > 0)" should have its body enclosed within curly braces. The current line has nothing after (x>0), so I'll add an empty block: "() {}".

Then, the else clause starts with "else b = 2;" which is followed by another closing brace "》". This extra brace at the end of the code is causing the error because it's not matched properly. So, I should remove that trailing brace.

So, replacing the if part and removing the extra brace should fix the issue. The corrected code should be:
if (x > 0) {} else b = 2;
...done thinking.

The original code has two issues: an unmatched curly brace inside the `if` statement and an extra closing brace at the end. 

- We need to enclose the body of the `if` statement within `{}`.
- The trailing `》` is removed as it's not needed.

Here is the corrected code:

```fix
if (x > 0) {} else b = 2;
```
