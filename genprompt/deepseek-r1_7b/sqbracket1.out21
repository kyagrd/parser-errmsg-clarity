Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me take a look at it. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, the error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. That means somewhere, the brackets are not closing properly.

Looking at the code, I see that inside the if statement, there's an array syntax: [ a = 1; ]. Wait, but in JavaScript or other languages, arrays are defined with [ and ], but here it's inside an if block. So maybe using square brackets for an array isn't correct here because the braces {} should be used instead.

Also, I notice that after the else statement, there's another ] which doesn't have a matching opening bracket. That extra closing bracket is causing the error because it's unexpected.

So to fix this, I think I need to replace the square brackets with curly braces since we're inside an if-else condition and not defining an array. That way, the code will correctly block the statements without any syntax issues.

Let me rewrite the code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Now, I've removed the square brackets and added curly braces where necessary. The if statement's condition is now using braces to enclose the single statement inside, and the else part correctly follows without any extra brackets.

I should also check for any missing semicolons or commas, but in this case, it looks like everything is properly separated with semicolons except for the array which we've replaced.

So that should fix the unexpected ']' error because now all blocks are properly closed.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
