Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided: 

```fix
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means the if statement already closed. Hmm, okay.

Looking at the code, I see that inside the if condition, it has `[ a = 1; ]`. Wait, that bracket is probably causing an issue because in JavaScript or similar languages, square brackets are used for arrays or objects, not for grouping conditions. So maybe those should be parentheses instead? Or perhaps they're unnecessary.

Then, after the if block, there's `else b = 2; ]`, which has two closing braces. That might be causing the error because the else statement expects a corresponding opening brace and then another one at the end of the code.

So first, I should check why there are square brackets around 'a=1'. Maybe they were meant to be parentheses for grouping? Or perhaps it's an incorrect usage altogether. Since in if statements, you don't usually use square brackets unless you're using a different syntax that I'm not aware of here. So probably, those should just be removed.

Next, looking at the else statement. It has `else b = 2; ]` with two closing braces. That's probably incorrect because each if-else block should end with one brace for its own code and another after it ends. In this case, maybe the first ']' is meant to close the inner part of the if condition, but perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, considering that inside an if statement in JavaScript, you don't need square brackets unless using something like array literals or a different construct. So removing the square brackets entirely makes sense here because they're causing an unexpected ] after else.

So putting it all together: remove the [ and ] around 'a = 1' and then make sure that each if-else block ends correctly with braces. Let's see:

The original code inside if is `[ a = 1; ]`, so removing the brackets, it becomes `a=1`. Then, after else b=2;, there's an extra ], which should be removed as well.

So the corrected code would be:

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

I think that makes sense. The if statement now correctly has its own block with braces, and the else is properly closed before the outer block ends.
...done thinking.

The error was caused by using square brackets `[ ]` around `a=1` which is unnecessary in an if condition, leading to an unexpected closing bracket after the else clause. Additionally, there were two closing braces at the end of the else statement.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
