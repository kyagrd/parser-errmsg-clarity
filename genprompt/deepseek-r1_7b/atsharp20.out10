Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code snippet. The code provided is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I notice that there are two lines with comments: one has '@ a = 1;' and another has 'else b = 2;'. 

First, looking at the first line, '@' is not valid syntax in most programming languages. Maybe it's trying to use some shorthand or macro, but without knowing the language, I should stick to common errors.

In the second line, there are two comment markers '#', which isn't correct because a single comment should end with one '#'. The second line starts at '#' and then has 'else b = 2;', so it's actually part of the same comment as the previous line. This means both lines have comments but only need to be removed or corrected.

I think removing the '@' and fixing the double comment is necessary. So, I'll remove '@ a = 1;' entirely. Also, since there are two '#' markers on the second line, it's causing an error because a line can't have two comment starts without proper syntax between them.

So, combining these thoughts, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) else b = 2;

This removes '@' and fixes the double comment by having only one '#'. Also, since 'else' is a keyword that needs to follow an 'if', I can directly place it after without any operator in between.

I'm pretty sure this should fix the syntax error because now each line has proper structure: condition followed by code on the same line.
...done thinking.

The code had two issues: the use of `@` which is invalid, and a syntax error due to multiple `#`. Removing these gives:

if (x > 0) else b = 2;

```
if (x > 0) else b = 2;
```
