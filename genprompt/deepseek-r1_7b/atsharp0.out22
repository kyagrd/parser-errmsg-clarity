Thinking...
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a piece of code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error" and the code snippet:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I'm supposed to only use the error message to figure out what's wrong without knowing any specific linters or syntax rules beyond that.

First, I'll look at the code. The user wrote an if statement: if (x > 0) and then they tried to write something after it using @ a =1;. Then there's # else b=2; # which looks like some kind of comment markers, probably in Ruby because of the #.

Wait, but this code isn't indented properly. In Ruby, indentation doesn't matter, but if this is within another block or language context, maybe it's causing issues.

Looking at the line with @ a =1;. The @ symbol might be used for something else depending on the programming language. If we're in Ruby, normally you'd just write a=1; without the @ unless it's part of a different construct like binding variables in a specific way.

Also, the code has # comments right after the if block and before the else. In some languages, having two consecutive conditions can cause issues because each condition should be separate with proper syntax between them.

So putting it all together, I think the main issue is that there's improper spacing or mixing of Ruby syntax in a way that creates confusion for the interpreter. The @a=1 part isn't valid Ruby unless it's using some special context which might not be intended here.

I should remove the # comments since they're unnecessary and causing confusion. Then, correct the line so that it properly assigns a=1 without the @ symbol. Also, fix the spacing between if, else, and their conditions to make sure they form valid statements.

So the corrected code would be removing the # markers, adjusting the lines so each statement is on its own line with proper indentation (though Ruby ignores indentation), but for readability, keeping consistent formatting.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0)
    a = 1
else
    b = 2
end
```

I fixed the syntax error by:

1. Removing the `#` comments as they are unnecessary in this context.

2. Properly indenting and structuring the code with each condition on its own line for clarity.

3. Correcting the assignment statements to use valid Ruby syntax (`a = 1` instead of `@ a = 1`) since the `@` symbol isn't used for assignments in standard Ruby.
   
4. Ensuring proper spacing between the if, else keywords and their conditions.
