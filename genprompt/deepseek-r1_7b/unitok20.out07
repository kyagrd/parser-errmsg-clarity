Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that has a syntax error. The user provided an example with some incorrect code and an error message saying there's a syntax issue. My task is to fix the code based solely on the error message, without using any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's in the message.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I remember that syntax errors usually come from incorrect structures or missing symbols. Let me break this down line by line.

First, the if statement: `if (x > 0)` looks okay on its own. It's checking if x is greater than zero.

Next part is where it gets tricky. The code after the if condition has these angle brackets: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Wait, I don't recognize those angle brackets as part of any standard syntax in common programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript. Maybe they're trying to use some custom syntax here.

Looking at the code structure, after the if condition, there's an else statement: `else b = 2;` but it seems to be followed by a closing angle bracket which doesn't make sense.

So, probably, the issue is with these angle brackets. They might not be part of the intended syntax and are causing the parser to think something is wrong.

I should consider what's missing. In many programming languages, if you have an if-else statement, each block inside needs proper scoping. Maybe the user intended to use curly braces `{}` for block delimiters instead of these angle brackets.

So replacing 《 with { and 》 with } might fix the syntax error because curly braces are standard in most languages for block structures.

Let me try that:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

That looks correct. Each if-else condition has its own block with curly braces, and the statements inside are properly indented.

So the main issue was using angle brackets instead of the standard curly braces for blocks.
...done thinking.

The error is caused by using angle brackets (`《` and `》`) instead of proper block delimiters like curly braces. These should be replaced to fix the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
