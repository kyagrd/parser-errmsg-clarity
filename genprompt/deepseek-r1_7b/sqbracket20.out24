Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code snippet. The user mentioned that the code might be from a language like C, Java, Python, etc., but it's probably using something else because of the way it's written. 

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I notice that there's an if statement with conditions and some assignments inside square brackets. In many languages, square brackets are used for arrays or objects, but in this context, they might be causing issues.

First error: The code has two closing braces instead of one at the end of the else block. The initial if condition is closed properly with ), then there's a ] which closes the if's body. But after that, another ] is present without a corresponding opening brace for the else statement. That's definitely an issue because each control structure should have its own set of braces.

So I need to adjust the brackets so that the code only has one closing brace at the end. Also, in languages like JavaScript or C-like syntax, the assignment inside if can be on the same line without semicolons sometimes, but here it's written as a = 1; which is fine except for the missing braces.

So I'll remove the square brackets around 'a=1' because they're not necessary. Then, make sure there's only one closing brace after the else statement to properly close the if-else block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```

The original code had syntax errors due to incorrect use of square brackets and missing braces. The fixed version removes unnecessary brackets while maintaining proper control flow using semicolons for assignments in an if-else structure.
Step-by-step explanation:
1. Removed the square brackets around `a=1` as they are not needed here.
2. Fixed the syntax by ensuring only one closing brace separates the if and else blocks.
3. Properly aligned the assignment statements to follow control flow rules.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
