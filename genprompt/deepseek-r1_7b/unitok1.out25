Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this code. The user provided some code with an error message and wants me to correct it using only the error message without any pre-trained knowledge. 

Looking at the error: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, I remember that in programming, especially in languages like Python or JavaScript, we use '<' and '>' for comparisons, not '《' and '》'. So those characters might be causing an issue.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
I notice that after the if condition, there's `《 a = 1; 》` and then another `》` at the end. The error message points out an unexpected '》' which suggests that this closing character is causing a problem.

Maybe the code was intended to use regular brackets for the else part. So instead of using 《 and 》, it should just use parentheses or maybe curly braces if it's for grouping expressions. But in Python, for conditional statements, we don't typically nest them with additional parenthesis unless needed for expressions.

Looking closer, the line after 'if' is an else clause without any condition, which might not be valid depending on the context, but that's a separate issue. The main problem here seems to be the use of 《 and 》 instead of regular '<' and '>' or perhaps just using the else statement correctly.

So I think replacing the 《 with < and the 》 after else with > should fix it. Also, there's an extra '》' at the end which shouldn't be there because it doesn't match any opening brace or parenthesis before it.

Let me rewrite that part:
Change `《 a = 1; 》` to `<a = 1;>` and remove the last `》`.

So the corrected code would be:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
Wait, but in Python, it's common to have indentation. But since the original code uses semicolons, maybe it's not using Python? Or perhaps it's JavaScript or another language that doesn't require colons for statements. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because the error message is about brackets and 《》 which aren't standard in those languages either.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant to use curly braces {} for some block but incorrectly used 《》 instead. But again, curly braces are usually opened with { and closed with }, not 《 or 》.

Putting it all together, I think replacing 《 with < and 》 after else with > should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) < a = 1;> else b = 2;
```
