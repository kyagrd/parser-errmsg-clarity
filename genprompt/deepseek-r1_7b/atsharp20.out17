Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code that's supposed to have a syntax error. The user provided the code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

And the error message is just "syntax error." My task is to fix this without using any pre-trained knowledge, only relying on the error message and symbols mentioned.

First, I notice that the code has `if` statements with conditions. In many programming languages, when you have a conditional statement like an if-else, you can't just end each line with semicolons unless it's part of a single-line statement or in specific contexts.

Looking at the code, after `(x > 0)`, there's an `@a = 1;` line. The '@' symbol is unusual here because I'm not sure what language this is. Maybe it's C? In C, `@` isn't a keyword, so that doesn't make sense.

Then, the next line has `else b = 2;`. Again, 'else' is part of an if-else structure in languages like C, Java, Python, etc. But here, after 'else', there's a space and then an assignment. That might not be correct because in some contexts, you can't have spaces between keywords and variable names.

Wait, the code uses `@a` which doesn't look like valid syntax. Maybe it should be something else, like `a = 1;`. Also, the lines are separated by semicolons at the end, but I'm not sure if that's correct in this context.

Putting this together, perhaps the code is meant to write an if statement with two parts: one where x >0 sets a variable and another else clause. So maybe it should be written as:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the original code, the braces are missing. The '@' is probably a typo for '=' or something else entirely.

So replacing `@a` with `a`, and adding the necessary syntax like braces to make it valid would fix the error. Also, using proper line breaks without semicolons unless they're part of an expression.

Therefore, the corrected code should remove the '@', add braces around each block, and ensure that variables are properly assigned.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
