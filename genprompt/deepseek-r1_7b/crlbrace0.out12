Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's a syntax error, and looking at the code provided:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

Hmm, let me break it down. First, I notice that after the else statement, the line ends abruptly without a closing brace for the if block. So the code as written is missing the opening and closing braces correctly.

In most programming languages like C++ or Java, each conditional statement needs to have its entire block enclosed within curly braces. The original code seems to be in such a style because it starts with { inside the if condition but doesn't close it properly before the else.

So, the first mistake is that after the if block's opening brace, there shouldn't be another open brace for the else statement. Instead, the else should directly follow without any extra braces. Also, the code ends with an extra closing brace which isn't needed because both cases (if and else) are covered within a single block.

Putting this together, I'll correct it by removing the unnecessary opening brace after if and ensuring that the entire condition is properly enclosed with just one set of braces. That way, when the else statement runs, it correctly falls through to the next line without any syntax errors.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error in the code provided, we need to ensure proper use of curly braces for conditional statements.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue**: The original code has an extra opening brace after the `if` statement and an unnecessary closing brace at the end. This causes the else clause to not be properly associated with the if block, leading to a syntax error.

2. **Correct Formatting**: Remove the extra opening brace `{` immediately after the `if (x > 0)` condition so that only one pair of braces encloses both the if and else statements. Also, eliminate the trailing closing brace at the end since all code paths within the initial block are accounted for by the single block.

3. **Resulting Code**: The corrected code will properly format the conditional statement with a single opening brace after `if` and correctly associate the else clause within the same block without any extra braces causing errors or unexpected behavior.

**Fixed Code:**
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
