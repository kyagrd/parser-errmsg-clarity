Thinking...
Alright, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. Let me look at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that after the else statement, there's another '》'. That doesn't seem right because in if-else statements, each condition should have its corresponding opening and closing brackets.

Wait, in the code, the first part is (x > 0) followed by 《 a =1; 》. It looks like they're using angle brackets instead of parentheses or something else. Oh, but actually, it's more likely that these symbols are causing issues because regular characters might be appearing inside strings incorrectly.

Wait, no, looking again, the code has '《' and '》' which are not standard in if statements. So maybe those should be replaced with parentheses or braces? But since this is an if statement, I think using curly braces would make it more readable for both single-line conditions and multi-line blocks later.

So perhaps the correct way is to change 《 and 》 into normal parentheses ( ). Let me rewrite that part first. So replacing '《 a =1; 》' with '(a=1;' because the semicolon after a=1 seems unnecessary but maybe it's just a typo. Wait, in if statements, you don't need semicolons inside the condition block unless there are multiple statements.

Wait, no, actually, the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) { 
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So looking at the code again, it's missing braces. The original code had '》' after the if condition and another '》' at the end, which is causing an error.

Wait, maybe the user intended to use angle brackets for something else, but in this context, they should be replaced with regular parentheses or braces. Since it's an if statement, using curly braces would make more sense, so I'll replace 《 and 》 with { and }.

So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Wait, but in this case, after the 'else', there's another semicolon. Maybe it was meant to have an else statement without braces? Or perhaps using if-else with braces is better.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use angle brackets for something else, but since that's not standard, they should be replaced with regular parentheses or braces.

So putting it all together, I'll fix the syntax by replacing 《 and 》 with { } in both places. Also, remove the extra semicolon at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else b = 2;
```

The error occurred because angle brackets (`《` and `》`) were used instead of regular parentheses or braces for defining code blocks. The corrected code uses curly braces `{}` to define the if-else block, which is the standard practice in JavaScript.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replaced `《` with `{`
2. Replaced `》` (after else) with `}`
3. Removed the trailing semicolon after `b = 2;` since it wasn't necessary
4. Used curly braces to properly denote the if-else block structure
