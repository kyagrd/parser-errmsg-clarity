Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this syntax error. So, looking at the code provided:

```ruby
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, first off, I notice that there are some comments in there using `#`. In Ruby, the shebang line is usually placed at the top of the file, so having it inside an if statement doesn't make sense. That's probably why there's a syntax error.

Also, looking at the structure, it seems like someone tried to use both an if statement and an else block. In Ruby, you can have elsif or else after an if, but they must be in sequence without mixing with other structures unless using case statements.

Wait, the code has `@ a = 1;` which looks like some kind of assignment inside an if condition. Maybe that's not valid syntax either. Perhaps it should just be `a = 1;` instead of using @.

So putting it all together, the code is trying to write something where if x is greater than 0, then a equals 1, else b equals 2. But Ruby doesn't allow mixing shebang with conditionals like that. So I think removing the shebang and placing the entire block as part of an if statement would fix it.

So the corrected code should be:

```ruby
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
end
```

That makes sense because now the conditions are correctly structured with proper indentation, and there's no shebang inside the if block.
...done thinking.

The original code has two issues: it includes a `#` within an `if` statement (which is invalid syntax) and incorrectly uses `@` instead of assignment. The correct approach is to structure the conditional statements properly without any shebang or misplaced assignments.

Here's the fixed version:

```ruby
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
end
```
