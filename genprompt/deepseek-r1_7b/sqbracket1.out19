Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means there's a missing bracket somewhere. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see that inside the if statement, there are brackets around "a=1;" but it ends with ], and then outside of the if block, after else, there's another ]. That might be causing the error.

Wait, in JavaScript, when you have an if-else structure, each block should be enclosed within curly braces. So the code inside the if and else should be wrapped in {} not []. Let me check that again.

The original code has (x > 0)[ a = 1; ] which uses square brackets instead of curly braces. That's probably incorrect because square brackets are for array literals, not for block structures.

So I think the fix is to change those square brackets into curly braces. Also, looking at the end of the else statement, there's an extra ], so that should be removed as well.

Let me rewrite it:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That way, each block after if and else is properly enclosed in curly braces, which should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect use of square brackets instead of curly braces for defining code blocks. The corrected code uses curly braces to enclose statements within both if and else clauses.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
