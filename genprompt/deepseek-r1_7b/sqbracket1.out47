Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see an if statement here. The structure seems to be: condition then braces, and then else with another assignment.

Wait, the problem message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. So maybe there's an extra bracket somewhere that's not needed.

Looking at the code, after the if block [ a = 1; ], the else is followed by b = 2; ] but it ends with another ]. That makes me think there are two closing brackets where there should be one.

So in the original code, after the if statement closes with ], then the else starts. But then after the else's assignment, another ] is present. That's probably an extra bracket from before or somewhere.

Wait, actually, looking at it again: [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Oh, I see! The code inside the if block has [ a=1; ], which closes with ]. Then outside, there's an else statement followed by another ] that's not needed. So the extra bracket is at the end after 'else'.

So to fix this, I should remove the last ]. That way, the structure would be:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;

That makes sense because each statement inside if and else doesn't need its own brackets unless they contain multiple statements. Here, both assignments are single-line, so no extra {}.

So I'll remove the last ], which is causing the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing bracket that should be removed to fix the syntax error. The corrected code removes the unnecessary `]` at the end of the else statement.

```fix
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
