Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The original code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Wait, that doesn't look right. I know that in programming, especially in languages like JavaScript or similar, when you have block statements inside conditionals, you usually use curly braces {} to enclose the code inside. The square brackets [] are not typically used for this purpose.

Looking at the code, after the if statement's opening bracket, there's a [ which probably shouldn't be there. Then inside that bracket is an assignment a = 1;. That makes sense inside the if block. But then after that, the else clause starts with 'else' followed by b = 2; and another ]. So it looks like they're trying to close both the if's and the else's blocks.

But I remember that in JavaScript, you can't have two ] immediately without a corresponding { or }. In this case, after the if block is closed with ], the code continues with else which doesn't have its own opening brace. So maybe it's causing an issue because there are extra brackets after the else.

Wait, actually, looking more carefully, the structure is:
if (condition) [ ... ] else ... ]

So inside the if block, we have a =1; between [] but that's wrong syntax because you can't just use square brackets like that. Instead, it should be using curly braces {}.

Additionally, after the if block's closing ], there's an else followed by b=2; and another ]. So maybe the extra ] is causing the error because the parser expects a corresponding { for the else clause.

So to fix this, I think we need to change the square brackets [ ] into curly braces { }. That way, inside the if block, it will correctly define the body of the conditional statement. Also, there's an extra closing bracket at the end which isn't needed because after the else, you don't close a block again.

So putting it all together, I'll replace the [] with {} in the if part and remove the trailing ] at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has syntax errors due to incorrect use of square brackets instead of curly braces for conditional blocks. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Replace the square brackets `[]` after `if (x > 0)` with curly braces `{}` because square brackets aren't used for block definitions in JavaScript.
2. Remove the trailing `]` at the end since it's not needed and causes an error.

The corrected code is:
```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
