Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The user mentioned an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a syntax issue in the if-else structure.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I notice that there are square brackets around `a=1` and another after `b=2`. Wait, why are they there? In most programming languages like Python or JavaScript, you don't put brackets after the statements in conditionals. So maybe those are causing some confusion.

The error message says there's an unexpected ']', so perhaps the code is expecting a block to close but it's not finding one. Let me count the brackets. 

After `if (x > 0)`, there's `[` and then `]`. That seems okay for closing the if block. But then after the else clause, there's another `[` which doesn't have a corresponding `]` before it ends. So that might be causing the error.

So maybe those brackets should just be removed because they're not necessary here. If I take them out, does the code make sense?

Let me try rewriting without the brackets:

```
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
```

Wait, but in the original code, after `else`, there's another `]`. So if I remove both sets of brackets, that might fix the issue. The else clause should just end without needing any extra brackets.

So by removing the square brackets around the assignments, the syntax error should be fixed because now each statement is correctly placed under its respective condition.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
