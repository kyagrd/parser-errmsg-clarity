Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's causing a syntax error. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, meaning the if statement already closed. Let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that the if statement has braces: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`. Then there's an else clause without braces and another brace at the end. So maybe the problem is with the extra closing brace.

Wait, in many programming languages like C or JavaScript, each block must be properly opened and closed. Let me check how this code is structured.

The if statement starts with { after (x>0), then inside the block there's a=1;. Then else b=2; but that's outside any block because it's not indented. But right now, after the else line, there's another } which would close the outer if block again. So actually, the code has two closing braces at the end: one after else and another at the end of the line.

Wait, no. Let me count the braces:

- The if statement opens with {, then inside is a=1;, then the if closes with }.
- Then there's an else which doesn't have braces around b=2; so it should be outside the if block.
- But in the code as written, after the else line, there's another }, which would close the if statement again. That's causing the error because the if block was already closed before.

So the problem is that there's an extra closing brace at the end of the code. The correct structure should have one opening and one closing brace for the if statement.

Looking at the original code, it's written as:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the else line, there's an extra }, which is causing the syntax error. To fix this, I should remove that last } so that only one closing brace remains.

Alternatively, if I want to keep both conditions in braces, maybe structure it like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }

But wait, in the original code, the else was followed by b=2 without braces. So perhaps the fix is just to remove the extra brace at the end.

Let me try removing the last }, so the code becomes:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

That should fix the syntax error because now the if statement only has one closing brace, matching the opening. Also, the else is correctly placed without an extra block.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
