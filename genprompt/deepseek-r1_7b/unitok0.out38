Thinking...
Alright, so I've got this code that's causing a syntax error. The user provided the code and an error message saying "syntax error." My task is to fix the code based solely on the error message without using any pre-existing knowledge beyond what's given here.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```
Hmm, I notice that there are some angle brackets being used instead of parentheses or braces. The words "if" and "else" suggest that we're dealing with an if-else statement in a programming language like Java or C++. In those languages, you use parentheses for the condition and curly braces for the blocks.

So, the code is using 《 and 》 around 'a = 1;' which seems incorrect. Maybe they were trying to represent something else, but that's not standard syntax. Similarly, there are extra closing brackets at the end after 'b=2;'.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, in an if-else statement, you have:
if (condition) { // code block when condition is true
    ...
} else {
    // code block when condition is false
}
So, each block should be enclosed within curly braces.

Looking at the original code, after 'if (x > 0)' there's a closing brace before the 'else'. But wait, it looks like they used 《 and 》 around 'a=1;' which probably isn't intended. Then after the else statement, there's another closing brace, making it look off.

So, I think the correct approach is to replace those angle brackets with curly braces because in Java or C++, we use curly braces for code blocks inside if statements. Also, ensure that each block is properly enclosed and closed without any extra or missing braces.

Let me reconstruct the code:

The original line is:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

So, replacing the angle brackets with curly braces where necessary. The 'a=1' part should be inside an if block, and 'b=2' should be in the else block.

Putting it all together:
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

Yes, that makes sense now. Each condition's code is properly enclosed within curly braces without any extra or missing ones.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
