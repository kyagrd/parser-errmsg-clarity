Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code and the error message. The error is just "syntax error," which means there's a problem with how the code is structured or written.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I see some issues here. First, I notice that the if statement has parentheses around "x > 0". That's correct because conditions in an if statement need to be in parentheses.

Next, looking at the lines after the parenthesis: there's a part where it says 《 a = 1; 》 and then another line with else b = 2; followed by another 》. The 《 and 》 symbols look like they might be angle brackets or maybe some kind of markup tags that aren't properly closed.

Wait, in the code, after the if statement's closing parenthesis, there are these angle brackets: 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》. It seems like the developer tried to use HTML-like tags but messed up the structure. Maybe they intended to have an if-else block inside those brackets.

So, first issue is that after the parenthesis of the condition, there's an opening angle bracket (《) which isn't properly closed before the else statement. Then, another closing angle bracket at the end. This causes a syntax error because the code doesn't close correctly and the interpreter doesn't know where each block ends.

Also, looking at how the statements are indented or spaced after those brackets is important. It seems like the "a = 1;" part is inside the if condition, but then the else statement comes right after without proper spacing or alignment.

To fix this, I should properly structure the if-else block. The correct syntax for an if-else in Java-like pseudocode (or actual Java) would be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So applying that to the code, I'll remove the extra angle brackets and properly indent each block. The opening brace { should come right after the if statement's parenthesis, and then the statements inside. Similarly, the else part needs its own block.

Let me rewrite it step by step:

Original problematic lines:
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I'll remove the angle brackets and use braces instead because in Java-like syntax, braces are used for blocks. So replacing 《 with { and 》 with }.

So it becomes:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This way, each block is correctly indented and enclosed within braces. Now the code should compile without syntax errors because the if-else structure is properly formed.
...done thinking.

The original code has incorrect use of angle brackets instead of proper braces and improper indentation/spacing in the if-else statement.

Here's the fixed version:

```java
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

This uses curly braces `{}` for block definitions, which is standard in most programming languages. The code now has correct syntax with each if-else block properly enclosed and indented.
