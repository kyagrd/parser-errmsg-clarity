Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause, which is already closed. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I can see that there are some angle brackets around 'a = 1' and another one after 'else'. Wait, in programming, especially with if-else statements, we usually use parentheses for the conditions. But here, I'm seeing angle brackets instead.

Oh, right! In PHP, you can write if statements using either parentheses or square brackets. Using square brackets is more modern and recommended these days. So maybe this code was intended to be in PHP but has some syntax mixed up.

Looking closer, after 'if (x > 0) ', there are angle brackets enclosing 'a = 1;'. In PHP, when using square brackets for if statements, the condition inside should be parentheses or curly braces for closures. So instead of '《 a = 1; 》', it should probably just be '( a = 1 )' and similarly for the else part.

Also, after the else clause, there's another angle bracket '》'. That doesn't seem right because in PHP, each if-else block ends with its own closing bracket. So having an extra one at the end would cause a syntax error.

So to fix this, I'll replace the angle brackets with square brackets where they are needed and remove the extra ones. Let me rewrite it step by step:

1. Change '《 a = 1; 》' to '(a = 1)'
2. Remove the last closing angle bracket after 'else b = 2;' because that's causing the error.
3. Ensure proper indentation for readability.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should look like this:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Wait, but in the original code, there were multiple spaces and tabs after each line. Maybe keeping some formatting is okay as long as syntax is correct.

So, maybe it's better to use braces with proper indentation instead of relying on PHP's square bracket syntax for clarity.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because angle brackets are used where they shouldn't be in an if-else statement in PHP. The corrected code uses parentheses and proper block structure.

Fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```
