Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. The error is a "syntax error," so something's wrong with the structure or logic of the code snippet provided.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
I notice that there are square brackets `[]` being used in an if-else statement. In many programming languages, parentheses `()` are typically used for conditionals, not square brackets.

The code starts with an if statement using parentheses correctly. Then inside the bracket, there's an assignment `a = 1;`. After the closing bracket of the if condition, there's another `]` which doesn't seem to have a corresponding opening bracket or parenthesis. This likely causes a mismatch in brackets, leading to a syntax error.

So, I think replacing the square brackets with parentheses would fix the issue. That means changing `[` to `( )`. Let me rewrite it:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Wait, but in some languages, if statements don't require braces `{}`, so maybe just replacing [ with ( and adding the necessary closing parentheses would work. Alternatively, perhaps the entire block was mistakenly written using square brackets instead of parentheses.

Another approach is to remove the extra square brackets altogether because they're not needed for an if-else statement in most languages. So, adjusting it as:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, each condition block has its own braces and follows proper syntax.
...done thinking.

The code contains a syntax error due to the use of square brackets `[]` in an if-else statement. In most programming languages, parentheses `()` are used for conditional statements instead of square brackets.

Here is the fixed code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
