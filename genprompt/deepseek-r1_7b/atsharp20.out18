Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's see... The user provided an error message: syntax error. The code they have is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, first off, looking at the code structure, it seems like there's some if-else logic here, but the way it's written might be causing issues.

I remember that in programming, especially in languages like C or Java, you can't have statements separated by semicolons unless they're on the same line. But here, I see an @ symbol between the if condition and a = 1; which probably isn't intended to be part of the code. So maybe the user meant to write something else there.

Looking closer, perhaps the @ is not necessary or was added by mistake. Also, the semicolon after if (x > 0) doesn't seem right because in some languages like C, you don't put a semicolon after control structures unless they're standalone statements.

Wait, maybe this code is supposed to be using some syntax from another language where the @ symbol has a specific meaning, but it's not relevant here. So perhaps the user intended to write an if statement with an else clause without any extra symbols.

So, I think the problem is that there are semicolons at the end of each line which might not be necessary in this context. Let me try removing them and see how the code looks.

Removing the semicolons after @ a = 1; and # else b = 2; should fix it because those lines aren't valid statements on their own, especially with the @ symbol which isn't part of standard control structures. So the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

I think that makes sense now. The if statement is properly structured without any extra characters, and each condition is on its own line without semicolons, which might have been causing confusion or syntax errors.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
