Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The user mentioned a syntax error, specifically pointing out that the code is written differently from languages like C, Java, or Python. Let me break it down step by step.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

First, I notice that there's an if statement here. In many programming languages, the if statement ends with a semicolon or a block of code enclosed in braces. Here, it starts with `if (x > 0)` and then has `[ a = 1; ]` inside square brackets, which are unusual for this context.

The error message is just "syntax error," so I'm guessing there's an issue with the structure here. The part after the else clause is `] else b = 2; ]`, which seems off because each condition in an if-else statement should end properly, probably with braces or some form of block closing.

Looking at the code, I see that inside the if condition, there's `[ a = 1; ]`. The square brackets here are probably not intended. Maybe they're leftover from another context, like array indexing, but in this case, they don't make sense because we're trying to assign a value to variable 'a' within an if statement.

Then, the else part starts with `else b = 2; ]`. Again, the trailing square bracket is suspicious. It looks like the developer intended to close an if block but instead used square brackets incorrectly.

I think the correct approach here would be to remove the unnecessary square brackets and use braces `{}` around the statements within each condition. So the if statement should have a single opening brace after the condition, followed by the code inside, which is the assignment `a = 1;`, and then a closing brace. Similarly, the else part should also enclose its block in braces.

Putting it all together, I'll rewrite the code without the square brackets, using curly braces `{}` instead. The fixed code should look like this:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

This way, each condition has its own block correctly enclosed with braces, which is standard in most programming languages and fits the syntax required here.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
