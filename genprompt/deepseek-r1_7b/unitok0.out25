Thinking...
Alright, so I have to fix this Python syntax error. The original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, looking at it, I notice that there are these fancy angle brackets 《 and 》 being used instead of regular parentheses. In Python, we use parentheses for conditionals, so using 《 and 》 might be causing issues.

Wait, the error message just says "syntax error," which is pretty broad. But in this case, it's likely because the code isn't properly formatted with parentheses. So replacing the angle brackets with regular ones should fix it.

So I'll change 《 to ( and 》 to ), but actually, since they are used inside the if statement, each block needs its own parenthesis. Let me see:

The original has two parts: one for when x > 0 and another for else. But looking at how it's written, maybe it's trying to write a single line with both conditions incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to have an elif or just the else clause. But regardless, focusing on syntax, using regular parentheses will fix it.

So rewriting the code:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

But in the original code, there's only one semicolon and then another part with ). So maybe I should adjust the brackets to properly enclose each statement. That way, the syntax error is resolved.
...done thinking.

The original code uses angle brackets (《 and 》) instead of regular parentheses for conditional statements in Python, which causes a syntax error. By replacing them with proper parentheses, we fix the issue.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b = 2;
```
