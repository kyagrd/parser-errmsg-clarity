Thinking...
Alright, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, first off, I notice that there are these angle brackets 《 and 》 being used instead of parentheses or something else. That's probably causing the syntax error because they aren't recognized as valid operators in an if statement.

So the original code is using 《 a = 1; 》 which should be replaced with regular parentheses (a = 1). Also, I see that after the else condition, there's another angle bracket 》 which isn't needed. In an if-else structure, each block should be enclosed within its own parenthesis. So instead of having both conditions wrapped in a single set, they should have their own.

Let me rewrite it step by step. The correct syntax for an if statement is:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

So I'll replace the 《 and 》 with regular parentheses around 'a = 1' inside the if block. Then, for the else part, I should close its block properly too.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;

I think that's right because each condition now has its own parentheses, and the statements inside are correctly enclosed. This should eliminate the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code uses incorrect angle brackets instead of regular parentheses in an if statement. We replace them with proper parentheses for both conditions.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replace 《 a = 1; 》 with (a = 1;) 
2. Remove the extra closing bracket 》 at the end
3. Ensure each block inside if-else is enclosed within its own set of parentheses

The fixed code:

if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;

```python
if (x > 0) ( a = 1; ) else b = 2;
```
