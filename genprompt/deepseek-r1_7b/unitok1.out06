Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in a Python code snippet. The user provided an error message and the original code. Let me try to figure out what's wrong.

First, the error message says: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like there's a typo or incorrect character somewhere. I know that in Python, we use parentheses for if statements, so the colon and brackets might be causing issues.

Looking at the code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

I notice two main issues here. The first is those characters 《 and 》. They aren't valid in Python syntax, so they're likely causing the error. In Python, we use parentheses for if statements, brackets [], or curly braces {} only for specific contexts like dictionaries or lists.

The original code starts with an if statement: if (x > 0). That's correct because it uses parentheses. Then there's a line where after the if block, someone wrote 《a =1;》, which probably isn't intended. Similarly, at the end of the else clause, they have another 》.

Wait, but why are these brackets present? It seems like an attempt to use curly braces, but in Python, only dictionaries and lists use those. So using them after if statements is incorrect because you don't need them there; a colon is enough.

So, the code should be simplified. The lines inside the if statement can be indented without any special characters. Let me rewrite it step by step.

The corrected code would remove the 《 and 》. It should look like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1;
else:
    b =2;

Wait, but in Python, you don't need the semicolons if you're on separate lines, so maybe that's not necessary either. But the main issue was the incorrect brackets.

So combining everything, the fixed code should use proper indentation and remove any unnecessary characters like 《 and 》.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
