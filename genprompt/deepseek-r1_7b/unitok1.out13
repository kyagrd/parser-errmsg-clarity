Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step. The error message says "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that's a bit confusing because 》 is probably not a valid character here.

Looking at the code: 

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I see that there are some characters like '《' and '》' around the statements. These look like they might be trying to use Chinese punctuation, but in Python, those aren't recognized as comments or syntax elements. So using them here is causing issues.

First, I notice that after the else clause, there's an extra 》. That's probably a typo and should be removed because it doesn't belong there. Also, the indentation of the if block seems off compared to standard Python formatting. In Python, it's common to use four spaces or a tab for indentation.

So, my plan is to:

1. Remove the '《' after `if (x > 0)` and before `a = 1;` because they're not valid syntax.
2. Correct the code structure so that everything aligns properly without extra characters.
3. Ensure proper indentation using four spaces for consistency.

After making these changes, the code should run without errors. Let me rewrite it step by step:

Original code with issues:
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

First, remove '《' and '》':
```
if (x > 0)    a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

Wait, that doesn't look right. I think the user intended to use comments or maybe had some formatting issues. Alternatively, perhaps they wanted to have an if-else block with proper indentation.

So another approach is:
After removing '《' and '》', adjust the code:

Remove extra spaces as well for cleaner code:
```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```

This looks correct. So the fixed code should have proper indentation, remove unnecessary punctuation, and structure the if-else block correctly.
...done thinking.

The error was due to incorrect usage of '《》' which are not valid in Python syntax. Removing them and ensuring proper indentation fixes the issue.

The corrected code is:

```
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
