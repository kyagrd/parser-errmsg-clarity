Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means the if statement was already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see that inside the if condition, they've written [a = 1;]. That seems odd because in programming, square brackets aren't typically used there. Usually, after an if statement, you just have a block of code indented without any extra brackets unless specified otherwise.

So probably, the mistake is using the brackets around 'a = 1;' when they shouldn't be there. Those brackets are causing an extra closing bracket which doesn't belong, hence the syntax error.

Let me try removing those square brackets. So instead of [ a = 1; ], it should just be a single line without the brackets. That way, the code will correctly close after the if statement and then proceed with the else part properly.

Rewriting that, the corrected code would look like:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

Yes, that makes sense because now each block of code is correctly indented and there's no extra closing bracket messing things up.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there are square brackets around `a=1;` which cause an unexpected closing bracket. Removing the unnecessary brackets fixes the syntax.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
