Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause, which means the if statement is already closed. Let me look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I see that inside the if condition, there are square brackets and some code inside: [a = 1;]. Then after the else clause, there's another ']'. But since the if statement already has its own closing ']', this extra one is causing an issue.

So, what's wrong here? The structure should be if (condition) { ... } else { ... }, right? But in the code, it's using square brackets instead of curly braces. Maybe that's part of the problem because square brackets aren't valid for block structures in JavaScript or similar languages.

Wait, but looking closer, inside the if condition, they have [a = 1;], which is probably an array literal with a semicolon at the end. But using square brackets here doesn't make sense because that would create an array and then a semicolon after it. That's not valid syntax on its own.

So, perhaps the code was intended to use curly braces instead of square brackets for defining blocks inside the if statement. If I change those square brackets to curly braces, maybe that will fix the issue. Let me try rewriting that part.

Original problematic line: if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Let's correct it by replacing the square brackets with curly braces:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

Wait, but in JavaScript, when you have an expression inside an if condition like that, you usually don't include it. If they meant to assign 'a' and then continue, maybe using semicolons isn't the right approach here. Alternatively, perhaps this code is part of a larger structure where those lines are within the if and else blocks.

But given the error about unexpected ']', I think the main issue was the extra square bracket after the else clause. So by removing that, it should fix the syntax.
...done thinking.

The original code has an incorrect use of square brackets instead of curly braces for defining code blocks inside the if statement. Additionally, there's an extraneous closing square bracket which is causing a syntax error.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
- Replaced `[` with `{` and `]` with `}` to correctly define the code blocks.
- Removed the extra closing square bracket after the if statement's block.
