Thinking...
Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the syntax error in the given code. The user mentioned that the code might be from a language different than C, Java, or Python, so I should look for symbols used in such errors.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
First, I notice there are two comments using `#`, which isn't valid syntax anywhere. So those lines shouldn't be there. Next, the line `if (x > 0) @ a = 1;` ends with an `@`, which isn't part of any control structure in C or other languages. Maybe it's trying to use some special operator.

In C, for example, you can have labels like `.text`. So perhaps replacing `@` with `.text` would make sense here. Also, the `;` at the end should be moved after the label so that the code compiles properly.

Putting it all together, I'll remove the comments and adjust the syntax to use `.text` instead of `@`, placing it before the assignment statement.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0).text a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Removed the two comment lines using `#`.
2. Replaced the invalid `@` with `.text` to create a label in C-like syntax.
3. Added semicolons after each statement as per language rules, ensuring proper control flow and assignment of variables.

The fixed code now follows valid C/C++/C# syntax with correct labels and assignments.
