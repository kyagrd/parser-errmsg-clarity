Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message is just a "syntax error," which is pretty vague, but let's see what the code looks like.

The code provided is:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I notice that there are some symbols here: `@` and `#`. In many programming languages, the `@` symbol isn't valid in an if statement. Maybe it's trying to be used for something else, like a comment or maybe part of a label?

Looking at the structure, after the `if (x > 0)` condition comes `@ a = 1;`, then a `#` which is likely a comment. So perhaps the code was intended to have an if-else statement where each branch is on a new line with proper indentation.

Wait, in some languages like C or Java, you can't have statements split across lines without proper braces. But here, maybe it's using a different syntax where statements can be split with semicolons and the `@` might be part of a comment separator?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to write something like an inline HTML comment? I remember that `<!-- -->` are used for comments in HTML, but that's not common in other languages.

Wait, looking again, after `if (x > 0)`, there's `@ a = 1; # else b = 2;`. The `#` at the end could be ending an inline comment. So maybe the code was meant to have comments after each branch of the if-else statement.

But in most languages, you can't have an `else` immediately after without any condition or with another condition. Wait, no, that's not right. The else is part of the if statement and requires a condition. But here, maybe it's trying to write something like:

if (x > 0) {
    @a = 1;
} # else b=2; #

But in many languages, you can't have an else without a condition unless using short-circuit operators or something else.

Wait another thought: Maybe the code is from JavaScript. In JS, you can write function expressions with `@` for arrow functions, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Python, where `@` is used for decorators, but again, not in an if statement context.

Wait, maybe this is a typo and the user intended to use `{}` for block statements. For example, in JavaScript or C++ you can write:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So perhaps replacing `@` with `{` would fix it.

Looking back at the code: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`

If I remove the `@` and replace it with `{`, then add `}` after else, but that might not be necessary if using semicolons for block scope. Wait, in some languages like JavaScript or C, you can have:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

So the fixed code would remove the `@` and ensure proper indentation.

Alternatively, maybe it's using a different syntax where each statement is on a new line without braces. So perhaps removing the semicolons after if and else? No, that doesn't make sense because in most languages, you need statements to end with semicolons or colons.

Wait, another angle: The code uses `@` followed by something which could be part of a comment syntax. Like in C, the preprocessor uses `#`, so maybe this is using some form of preprocessing where `@` starts a macro argument and then `#` ends it. But after that, there's an else statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to have comments but got mixed up with the if-else structure.

Wait, let me think about how this might be valid syntax somewhere. Maybe in a language where you can write expressions or use assignment operators inline within conditions. For example, maybe it's some kind of expression evaluation, and `@` is part of that syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using a different programming paradigm, like an expression tree or something else entirely, but I'm not sure.

But considering the error message just says "syntax error," which often points to missing braces, incorrect indentation, or improper use of operators. So looking at the code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

It seems that after `if`, there's an `@` and then `a=1;`, which might be intended as part of the if condition, but it's not valid syntax. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to have comments within each branch.

Wait, maybe the code was meant to write:

if (x > 0)
    @ a = 1;
else
    # b = 2;

But without braces, that might cause issues in some languages where statements need to be properly indented or grouped. However, in Python, indentation is crucial for block structure, so if the code was intended for Python, removing the `@` and adding proper else clause would fix it.

Alternatively, perhaps the `@` is part of a variable name or something else entirely.

Wait, another thought: In some contexts, like regular expressions, you can have different syntax, but that's probably not relevant here.

So putting it all together, I think the main issue is the `@` after if. Replacing `@` with `{` would fix it, assuming we're using a language where block statements are written with curly braces.

Alternatively, perhaps adding an else clause properly, but since there's already `else b = 2;`, maybe just removing the `@` and adjusting indentation or braces is needed.

Wait, looking at the original code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

If I remove the `@` between if and a=1, then it would be:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But that doesn't make much sense because in an if-else statement, you can only have one action per branch. So perhaps adding braces around each block.

So the correct code would be to change `@` into `{`, and remove the trailing `}` after else since it's part of the comment.

Wait, but then we'd need to properly indent:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in that case, perhaps using `{` instead of `@`.

So replacing `@` with `{`, and ensuring proper indentation would fix the syntax error.

Another possibility is that the code was trying to use an inline comment after each branch. So maybe:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; /* else b=2; */

But I'm not sure if that's how comments work in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps `@` is part of a line continuation or something like in some languages where you can split lines without braces.

Wait, maybe it's using the C-style line continuation with backslash `\`, but there's no backslash here. So I'm not sure.

Given all these possibilities, the most straightforward fix seems to be replacing `@` with `{` to form proper block scope. Let me check that:

Original code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Fixed code would replace `@` with `{`, resulting in:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

But considering the original code's structure, perhaps it was intended to have each branch on its own line without using braces but with proper indentation and comments. So maybe:

if (x > 0)
    @a = 1;
# else
    b = 2;
#

But that seems less likely.

Alternatively, if `@` is part of a different syntax, perhaps it's meant to be removed entirely, leaving the code as an if statement with two separate statements without braces. But that would require proper semicolon placement and indentation.

Wait, another angle: Maybe `@` is being used for something else in this context, like a variable or function name, but then why use `=`? That's unclear.

Given all these possibilities, I think the main issue is the presence of `@`, which isn't valid syntax. So replacing it with `{` would fix it if we're assuming that the code is meant to be in a language where curly braces denote blocks.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because `@` is not recognized as valid syntax after an `if` statement. Replacing `@` with `{` fixes this.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
