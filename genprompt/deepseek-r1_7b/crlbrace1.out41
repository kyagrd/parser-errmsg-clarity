Thinking...
Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to fix a syntax error in some JavaScript code. The user provided an error message and the incorrect code. Let me try to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.

First, the error message says: "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that suggests there's a problem with braces somewhere. So I need to check where the braces are in the code.

Looking at the code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```
I see that the if statement starts with an opening curly brace `{` after `if (x > 0)`. Then inside, there's an assignment statement. The else clause is next, followed by another curly brace and then some code.

Wait a minute, let me count the braces. The first part is `if (...) { ... } else ...;`. So the if block has one opening brace `{` and one closing `}`. Then outside of that, after the else statement, there's another `}` at the end. But wait, in the code, after the else clause, it's `else b = 2; }`, so the semicolon is right before the last `}`, which might not be correct.

Wait no, actually looking again: The code is written as:
if (x >0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

So the structure is:

if (...) {
   a=1;
}
else
   b=2;

But that's incorrect because in JavaScript, after an else statement without an opening brace, you don't need to close the if block immediately. Wait no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me parse it correctly. The code has three parts: the if condition with a block, then the else part which is outside of the if's block but inside the same outer scope?

No, wait, in JavaScript, each if statement can only have one body, and that body must be enclosed in braces. So after an else, you shouldn't have another brace unless it's for an inner block.

Wait, perhaps the code has a syntax error because the else is outside of any block. Let me see: The if condition opens with `{`, then inside is `a=1;`. Then comes `}` which closes the if block. So after that, the next statement should be at the same level as the if's opening brace.

But in the code, after the first `}`, there's an else followed by a semicolon and another `}`. That might not make sense because the else isn't part of any block.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to break it down:

The correct structure should be:
if (condition) {
   // statements
} else {
   // statements
}

So in this case, the user has written it as:
if (...) { a=1; } else b=2; }

Which would have an extra closing brace at the end. Let me count the braces:

- After if: one opening `{`
- Inside that block, `a=1;` and then another `}` closes the if.
- Then comes `else b=2; }`, so after else, there's a semicolon and another `}`.

So the code as written would have two closing braces at the end. Wait no, let me count:

The first line: { opens, ends with }, which is one pair for the if block.

Then after that, the next statement is `else b=2; }`, so that's a single brace? Or does it mean another level?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how JavaScript interprets this code.

The user wrote:
if (...) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

So after the if block closes with `}`, then the next statement is an else without any opening brace, so it should be at the same level as the if's opening. But in that case, putting another semicolon and another `}` would cause the error.

Wait, perhaps the code has two closing braces: one for the if and another which isn't needed because the else doesn't have a block. So the mistake is having an extra `}` at the end.

So to fix it, I should remove that last `}` so that only one closing brace remains after the if's body. Let me write out the corrected code:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;

This way, there are no extra braces, and each statement is correctly placed. The if block has its own braces, and the else is properly placed outside of it without needing another brace.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there's an extra closing brace after the `else` clause. Removing this redundant brace fixes the syntax.

```javascript
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```
