Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the code provided. Let me look at the code again: `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #`. Hmm, I remember that in some programming languages like C or Python, you can use comments to ignore certain lines. 

Wait, the line has an `@` symbol followed by something. Oh right! In Go, there's a syntax for ignoring code using `@` and then a comment. It's used when you don't want that part of the code to compile. So maybe this is intended as a guard clause.

So in Go, if I have an `if` statement, I can add `@` after it and before the body, which effectively comments out or ignores any code between `@` and `#`. Then, anything after the comment will be part of the else block. 

Let me break it down: The original line is trying to handle two cases. If x > 0, then a =1; else, b=2;. But right now, the if statement isn't properly followed by its body because of the `@` and comment.

So I should adjust the code so that after the if condition, there's an @, then a # to ignore any code between them. Then, the rest of the statements (a=1; else b=2;) should be part of the else block. 

Putting it all together, the corrected line would be `if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;`. That way, when x>0 is true, it assigns a=1, otherwise, it goes to else and assigns b=2.

I think that makes sense. Let me check if this syntax is correct in Go. Yes, using `@` followed by a comment allows you to skip lines, effectively merging the else part into one line. So this should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error because it uses an `@` symbol before a comment which is not valid in Go for if statements. The correct way is to use `@` followed by a newline or comment within the body of the if statement, but since we're combining lines, we can place the comment after the else clause.

Here's the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
