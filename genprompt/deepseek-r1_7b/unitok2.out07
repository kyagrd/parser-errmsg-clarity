Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a code snippet with a syntax error and an error message indicating where the issue is. My task is to fix the code using only the information from the error message without relying on any pre-existing knowledge beyond what's given.

First, I'll read through the error message carefully: "unexpected '》' after else clause (if statement already closed)". This tells me that there's a problem with the character '》' in the code. Typically, when an unexpected character appears, it might be a closing bracket or brace that doesn't match correctly.

Looking at the original code:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

I notice that after the if statement's condition, there are two characters: '《' and '》'. Similarly, after the else clause, there's another '》'. These look like angle brackets or some kind of special symbols.

The error message says there's an unexpected '》' after the else clause. That suggests that somewhere in the code, a closing character doesn't match its opening counterpart. In this case, maybe the '《' is intended as an opening bracket for something, but it's not properly closed or used.

Wait, perhaps the code is using a different kind of syntax where '》' isn't a valid closing bracket after else. Or maybe the brackets are nested incorrectly.

Looking again, the structure is:

if (x > 0) 《 ... ; 》 else b = 2; 》

So after the if block, there's a 《 and then inside it has some code, followed by a 》 closing it. Then outside that, after the else, there's another 》.

But in standard syntax, an if statement doesn't have its own braces unless explicitly used with curly braces. So maybe the code is trying to use angle brackets instead of parentheses for grouping? Or perhaps it's using some custom syntax where '《' and '》' are supposed to be brackets for something else.

Wait, another possibility: the code might be mixing up different types of brackets. For example, in Python, we don't have 《 or 》 as special characters; they are Unicode. But looking at the error message, it's complaining about an unexpected '》', which is a closing angle bracket that doesn't match anything before.

In the original code, after the if block, there's a 《 and then inside (a=1), followed by a 》. Then outside of that, another 》 after else b=2;.

So perhaps the problem is that the first 》 closes something it shouldn't. Let me see: in the code, the structure is:

if (x>0) 《 ... ; 》 else ...

This looks like an if-else statement where each clause has its own condition and then some expressions. But with angle brackets instead of braces or other delimiters.

Wait, maybe the user intended to use curly braces for the if block, but wrote parentheses by mistake? Or perhaps they're using a different syntax that requires these specific characters.

But focusing on the error message: unexpected '》' after else clause, and the if statement is already closed. So the issue might be that the outer 》 doesn't have a matching opening bracket before it when it reaches the else clause.

So let me try to parse this code:

- The first part is if (x>0) with some content inside: 《 a=1; 》
- Then, outside of that, there's an else b=2; followed by another 》

But the else is at the same indentation level as the initial if, so perhaps it's not nested. Wait, no, in code, after an else clause, you can't have a new closing bracket unless it's part of some structure.

Wait, maybe the outer if statement doesn't close properly because the 》 is misplaced. Let me try to count the opening and closing brackets:

The code starts with (x>0) then has 《 ... ; 》 else b=2; 》

So after the initial 'if' block, which is enclosed by parentheses, we have a 《 that's not part of any enclosing structure. Then inside it, there's some code, and then it closes with 》.

But perhaps this 》 should be a closing brace for something else? Or maybe it's an error because the outer if statement was intended to close after its own block, but instead is being followed by another 》 which doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the 'else' is expecting a colon and then some code inside curly braces. But in this case, the user wrote else b=2; without any curly braces. So perhaps the structure should be:

if (x>0) { ... } else { ... }

But the original code uses 《 and 》 instead of curly braces.

Wait, but looking at the error message again: it's complaining about an unexpected '》' after else clause. That suggests that when processing the else part, there's a 》 which isn't properly closed or matched.

Perhaps the outer structure is:

if (x>0) { ... } else b=2;

But in this case, the code uses 《 and 》 instead of curly braces. So maybe the fix is to replace those with proper braces.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use some other kind of syntax where '《' and '》' are not necessary but were mistakenly included.

Wait, another angle: maybe the code was meant to be in a context where the else statement doesn't need an if block at all. So perhaps removing the 《 and 》 entirely would fix it.

Looking back, the code is:

if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2; 》

So maybe the user intended to have two separate statements: one under if, another under else, without needing any braces. But in many programming languages, you can't just write like that unless using block style or inline.

Alternatively, perhaps the code was meant to be a chain of expressions, but it's not properly structured.

But given the error message is about an unexpected '》', I think the main issue is that there are too many closing brackets. So maybe removing the extra 》 would fix it.

So if I look at the code:

if (x>0) 《 a=1; 》 else b=2; 》

After the else clause, there's an extra 》 which doesn't have a matching opening bracket. So perhaps that last 》 is not needed and should be removed.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the code was supposed to be:

if (x>0) { a =1; } else { b=2; }

But instead, it's using 《 and 》 which might not be necessary. So perhaps replacing those with curly braces would fix it.

Alternatively, if the original code uses some custom syntax where '《' and '》' are used as delimiters for expressions, but that seems less likely.

So, considering all this, I think the problem is that there's an extra 》 at the end after else b=2; which doesn't have a matching opening bracket before it. So removing that last 》 would fix the syntax error.

Alternatively, if '《' and '》' are supposed to be used instead of curly braces for some reason, then perhaps changing them to regular {} would solve the issue.

But given the user's instruction to use only the characters mentioned in the error message (which includes 》), I think it's safe to remove the extra 》 at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;
```
