Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that's giving me an error. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which is part of an if statement already closed. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, so I see that there's an if statement checking if x is greater than zero. Inside the curly braces, they have 'a = 1;', which makes sense. Then outside the brace, but still inside the same if-else block, it says 'else b = 2;' and then another closing brace.

Wait a minute, that doesn't look right. The else statement should be followed by its own block enclosed in curly braces, just like the if statement. But here, they're not using any braces for the else part. So when the code parses, it's expecting to close the else block but finds an extra closing brace instead.

Let me think about how this should look. The correct structure would be:

if (condition) { ... } else { ... }

So in this case, both the if and else parts should have their own braces. So I need to add curly braces around 'else b = 2;'.

That means after the else statement, I should open a new brace and then put 'b = 2;' inside it before closing the else block.

Let me rewrite that part. The original code has:
```
} else b = 2; }
```

I need to change this to:
```
} else { b = 2; } }
```

Wait, no, let's break it down step by step. The if statement starts with 'if (x > 0) {' and ends with '}'. Then the else should have its own braces.

So after the else keyword, I need to open a new curly brace before writing 'b = 2;'. That way, everything inside is properly enclosed.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Wait, but I also noticed that in the original code, there's an extra closing brace at the end. The original ends with '}' after the else statement, which is causing the syntax error because there's no corresponding opening brace for that else block.

So removing the last closing brace would fix it as well. So putting it all together, I'll adjust both issues: adding braces around the else part and removing the extra closing brace at the end.
...done thinking.

The code has an error where the `else` statement is not enclosed in curly braces. Additionally, there's an extra closing brace that should be removed.

Here's the fixed version:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Add `{` after `else`.
2. Open another `{` before `b = 2;`.
3. Remove the last `}` at the end of the line.

This ensures each statement inside if and else is properly enclosed within their respective braces, resolving the syntax error.
