Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

First, the original code is:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that it's using these symbols 《 and 》 which aren't valid in standard Python. The error message just says there's a syntax error, so maybe those are causing issues.

In Python, after an if statement, you typically have an indented block for when the condition is true, and then an else block when it's false. So I think the code should be written using regular parentheses or brackets.

Let me rewrite it with parentheses to match how an if-else structure works in Python. That would look like:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Wait, but in the original code, the else part is written as "else b = 2;" without any indentation. So I need to make sure that the indented block under if and else are correctly placed.

Putting it all together, the corrected code should replace the 《 and 》 with parentheses and properly indent the statements inside each condition.
...done thinking.

The original code uses non-standard symbols which cause a syntax error. Replacing them with standard parentheses fixes the issue.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
