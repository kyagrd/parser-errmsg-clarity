Thinking...
Alright, I'm looking at this code snippet and trying to figure out what's wrong with it. The user mentioned a syntax error, so something isn't quite right here.

The code is: 
```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, I know that in many programming languages like C or Java, the if statement doesn't use curly braces around each block. So maybe this syntax is from another language where using braces isn't standard? But looking at it again, the error message just says "syntax error," so there's definitely an issue.

Let me break down the code structure. The if condition is correct: `(x > 0)`. Then there are these parts inside what looks like curly braces or some kind of block: `《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》`.

Wait, in most languages, after an if statement without braces, you just have the statements indented. So maybe the user is trying to write it with braces but messed up the syntax.

Looking at the first part inside what seems like a brace: `《 a = 1; 》` – that's probably incorrect because the opening and closing braces aren't in the right order or there are extra symbols. The same goes for the else block: `else b = 2;` is written outside of any brace, which might not be valid.

I think the problem here is the use of these fancy brackets (`《 》`) instead of regular curly braces `{}`. In many languages, if you want to group statements with braces, they should be placed correctly. So maybe replacing `《` and `》` with `{` and `}` would fix it.

Also, looking at how the code is structured: after the if condition, there's an else statement without any block in between. That doesn't make sense because the else clause typically comes right after the if, each followed by their own block of code. So perhaps the extra braces are causing confusion and leading to a syntax error.

So putting it all together, I think the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

That way, each statement is properly indented under its respective if or else clause. Also, using regular curly braces `{}` instead of `《 》` which might not be recognized by the interpreter.

I should check if this makes sense in terms of syntax. In Python, for example, this would be valid. The code inside the if and else blocks is correctly indented and enclosed within braces (which are actually parentheses in some contexts, but here it's using curly braces). Wait no, in Python, you don't use curly braces for conditionals; they're used for dictionaries or other structures.

Wait a second, maybe I'm mixing up languages. The user mentioned that the syntax might be different from C, Java, etc., so perhaps it's another language where braces are used more liberally.

But regardless, the main issue seems to be incorrect placement of braces and possibly not using them correctly for control structures. So replacing `《 》` with `{}` should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

The original code has issues with brace usage. The correct syntax uses curly braces `{}` properly without any additional symbols like `《 》`. Here's the fixed version:

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
