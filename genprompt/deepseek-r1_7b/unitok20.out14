Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》
```

Hmm, first, I notice that there are two closing quotes before the 'else' statement and another after it. That's probably causing a syntax error because each opening quote should have a corresponding closing one.

Wait, looking closer, between `if (x > 0)` and `a = 1;`, there are two 《 symbols. So maybe these are not regular quotes but some kind of angle brackets or something else used in the language this code is written for. But regardless, the structure seems off because after the if statement, both branches should have their own blocks.

So perhaps the correct structure should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But I need to replace the angle brackets with curly braces since they don't match the rest of the code. Let me see how that would look in the original code by replacing the angle brackets with {}.

So, changing it from 《 and 》 to { }, both inside the if block and the else block.

Putting it all together:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That should fix the syntax error because now each statement is properly enclosed within curly braces, which are standard in many programming languages for control structures.
...done thinking.

The code has unbalanced angle brackets. The correct structure uses curly braces `{}` instead of angle brackets `《》` since they don't match the surrounding syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
