Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to help fix this code that has a syntax error. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause. Hmm, looking at the code:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

I notice there are two lines with '#', probably comments. In many programming languages like C or Java, having two separate comment blocks might not be allowed within an if statement because it could cause unexpected behavior or misinterpretation of the code structure.

Wait, in some languages, a single line can have multiple statements separated by semicolons, but each comment is on its own line. Here, there's only one else clause after the if block. So maybe having two separate # comments is causing confusion for the compiler.

The error message specifically mentions an unexpected '#' after the else clause, which suggests that a comment is placed incorrectly where it shouldn't be. Perhaps combining both lines into one would fix this issue because the code might not expect multiple comments in that context.

So I'll remove the extra line with the '#', leaving only one comment on the second line.
...done thinking.

The code has two separate comment lines which interfere with each other and cause a syntax error. Combining them fixes the issue.

```fix
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
