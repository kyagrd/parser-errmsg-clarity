Thinking...
Okay, I need to fix the syntax error in this code. The user provided an error message: "syntax error". Let me look at the code they gave:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that there are angle brackets being used instead of parentheses or curly braces. In programming, angle brackets aren't standard syntax unless it's something specific like HTML. So probably, these should be replaced with regular parentheses or curly braces.

Wait, the code is using 《 and 》 which look like styled angle brackets. Maybe they're trying to represent a block structure. Let me think about how conditionals are usually structured in programming languages. They often use {} for blocks.

Looking at the if statement: if (x > 0) { ... } else ...

So, I should replace the 《 and 》 with { and }, but actually, each one is used to start and end a block. So probably, it's better to just change them to regular curly braces or parentheses.

Wait, in Python, for example, you can write if statements using parentheses. So maybe the code was intended to be:

if x > 0:
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

So looking back at the original code, there's an extra angle bracket after the else statement. The line "else b = 2; 》" has two closing brackets: one before and one after.

I think the issue is that they're using the wrong characters to denote block scope. So I'll change those to regular curly braces or parentheses. But in this context, since it's an if-else statement, using curly braces makes more sense because Python uses them for blocks.

So rewriting the code with proper indentation and correct brackets:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Wait, but I can also change the angle brackets to parentheses. However, in this case, since it's an if statement without any braces, using parentheses might not be standard. But Python uses colons for conditions and then indented blocks.

Alternatively, maybe they meant to use curly braces as block delimiters. So perhaps replacing 《 with { and 》 with }, but adjusting the structure correctly.

So putting it all together, the fixed code would have the if condition followed by a colon, then an indented block with the assignment, then else colon, another indented block, and that's it without needing to close the outer block again because Python doesn't require it in this case. Wait, no, actually, in some languages like C or JavaScript, you might need braces, but in Python, it's optional for single statements.

Wait, looking back at the original code, there are two closing angle brackets after the else statement: 》 and another 》. So that's probably a typo. So I'll fix all instances of 《 to { and 》 to }, making sure each if-else block is properly closed with only one set of braces.

So step by step:

1. Replace the first 《 after if (x > 0) with {.
2. Remove the extra closing } at the end that's not needed because it's just a single line in each block.
3. Ensure proper indentation for readability.

Putting it together, I'll write:

if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2

Yes, this should fix the syntax error by using correct curly braces and proper indentation.
...done thinking.

The code has incorrect use of angle brackets instead of parentheses or braces. The fixed version uses proper block delimiters with proper indentation.

```python
if (x > 0):
    a = 1
else:
    b = 2
```
