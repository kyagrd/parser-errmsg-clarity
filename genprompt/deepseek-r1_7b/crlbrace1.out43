Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code provided is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Alright, so I see an if-else statement. The code starts with the if condition: if x is greater than zero, then inside curly braces, it assigns a to 1. Then there's an else clause where it tries to assign b=2. But after that else, there's another } which is causing an issue.

Wait, let me count the braces. The if statement has { and }, so that's one pair. Then the else is right after without any condition. So inside the else, they just have a statement b=2; but then another } comes at the end, making it three curly braces in total? That can't be right.

So probably, the extra } at the very end is causing the problem because there's only one if block and an else clause without its own block. Or maybe not even that—perhaps the else isn't properly connected to the if statement. Wait, no, else always goes with the if.

Looking again: the code has two blocks inside if-else structure? No, it doesn't. The first part is the if condition and one brace, then an else without any braces or a condition, which can't be right because else needs to have its own block.

Wait, no, in some languages like JavaScript, the else can immediately follow the if, but in others, you need an explicit condition. Wait, actually, in JavaScript, I think the syntax allows else without a condition only when it's part of a multi-line if-else structure. Or is that not correct?

Wait, let me check: In JavaScript, you can write:

if (condition) { ... }
else { ... }

Or

if (condition)
  doSomething();
else
  doSomethingElse();

But in the code provided, after else b=2; there's another } which isn't matched. So probably, the extra brace is causing a syntax error.

So let me parse this step by step:

- The first line: if (x>0) { a=1; }
That uses one pair of braces correctly.
- Then else b=2;
This starts an else clause but doesn't have its own block. So it's missing the opening brace, but in the code, after else there's another }, which is causing the problem.

Wait no, looking again: The code as written is:

if (x>0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

So breaking it down:

Line 1: if (condition) { ... }
Line 2: else ... ; 

But then Line 3 has another }, which would be the closing brace for the outermost if statement. But after that, in line 4? No, because there's only three lines including the else and the extra }.

Wait no, let me count:

The code is written as:
if (x>0) { a =1; }
else b=2; }

So actually, it's two statements: the if block with one closing brace, then an else statement which should have its own opening brace. But in the given code, after else there's no open brace, but instead another }, making it three braces total.

Wait, that would be:

Line 1: { ... }
Line 2: } 
Then Line3: else b=2; }
Which is incorrect because else needs to have its own block. So in the given code, after else, there's an extra }, which isn't needed unless else has a block.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure should be:

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else {
  b=2;
}

In that case, the code is missing the opening brace for the else block. But in the given code, it's written as:

if (x>0) { a =1; } else b=2; }

Which ends with an extra }, making it have three braces.

So to fix this, we need to add an opening brace after else so that the else has its own block. Let me visualize:

Original code:
Line 1: if (condition) { ... } // correct
Line 2: else b=2; // missing brace and then another }

So line 2 is "else b=2; }" which causes an extra brace.

Therefore, the fix would be to add a { after else so that it's:

if (x>0) {a=1;}
else {
  b=2;
}

But in code form, without the comments or added lines, we can write it as adding the opening brace and removing the extra } at the end.

So the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }
```

That way, each block is properly enclosed with its own braces.
...done thinking.

To fix the syntax error, add an opening brace for the else statement and remove the extra closing brace at the end. The corrected code now has matching braces for each if-else block.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else { b = 2; }
```
