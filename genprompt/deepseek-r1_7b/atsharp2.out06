Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected '#' after the else clause of an if statement which already closed. Let me look at the code again:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I see that after the if block, there's an else statement with some code. But it seems like the syntax is off because of the '#' signs.

Wait, in many programming languages, the else clause must be properly indented and aligned with its corresponding if statement. Here, maybe the issue is that the else part isn't correctly structured within the if block.

Looking closer, I notice that after the @ operator, there's an assignment a=1; but then outside of any if-else structure, there's an else b=2; which doesn't make sense because it's not connected to the if statement. Also, the code ends with two '#' symbols, which might be causing confusion.

Perhaps the correct way is to include the else clause within the same block as the if. So instead of having separate lines outside, I should adjust the indentation so that else aligns properly under the if.

So, removing the # signs and ensuring proper alignment should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; 
    else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The original code has an unexpected '#' after the else clause, indicating incorrect block structure.
2. The 'else' statement was not properly aligned under its corresponding 'if', leading to syntax errors.
3. By removing the extra '#' signs and aligning 'else' correctly under the if, the syntax error is resolved.

Fixed Code:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; 
    else b = 2;
```
