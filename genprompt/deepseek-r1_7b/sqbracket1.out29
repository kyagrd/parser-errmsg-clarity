Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message says there's an unexpected ']' after the else clause. Hmm, let me look at the code again.

The code is written as:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```
Wait, I see that inside the if statement, they have `[ a = 1; ]`. That looks like an array or an object syntax. But in this context, it's probably trying to assign `a` to 1 when `x >0` is true.

Then, there's an else clause: `else b =2; ]`. Oh, I notice that after the else statement, there's another ']' which doesn't belong. The first part `[ a=1; ]` closes with a bracket, and then the else also ends with ']'. That's causing the error because it's expecting something after else but finds a closing bracket instead.

So, what should I do? Let me think about how if-else statements work in programming. Typically, you write `if (condition) { ... } else { ... }` or sometimes using square brackets for shorter code, like `[a=1;] else b=2;`. But when using semicolons, each statement should end correctly.

In the original code, after the if block, which ends with ']', then comes `else b =2; ]`, which is incorrect because the else doesn't need another ]. The else should be followed by a statement or a closing brace. So I think the extra ']' at the end is the problem.

I'll remove that last ']' so it becomes:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
Now, let me check if this makes sense. The if block assigns a=1 when x>0, and else assigns b=2. That seems correct without any syntax errors.

So the main issue was the extra closing bracket at the end of the code, which wasn't needed.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because there's an extra closing bracket `]` after the `else` statement. This bracket doesn't belong in this context and should be removed.

**Fixed Code:**
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2;
```
