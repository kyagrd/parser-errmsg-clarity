Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The user mentioned an "unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)" which is pointing out some issue with braces in the code. Let me look at the provided code.

The original code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that there's an extra closing brace at the end after the else statement. The code starts with an if block: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; }`, which is correct—closing braces properly. Then comes the else part: `else b = 2; }`. Wait, so after the else, there's another closing brace? No, that can't be right because in the code, it looks like the else doesn't have its own block. So maybe the problem is that the else statement isn't properly enclosed.

Let me parse this step by step. The if condition checks if x > 0 and inside the block, a is set to 1. Then, outside of that block, there's an else followed by b=2; but then there's another closing brace at the end which shouldn't be there because the else doesn't have its own curly braces.

So I think the code intended was:
- if (x >0) { a =1 }
- else { b=2 }

But in the original, the else is followed by b=2; } without the braces. So the extra closing brace at the end of the original code is causing the syntax error because it's not needed.

So to fix this, I need to add braces around the else statement so that both if and else have their own blocks. That means changing:
```
} else b = 2;
}
```
To
```
} else { b = 2; }
```
This way, each condition has its own block, and the syntax error is resolved.
...done thinking.

The code has an extra closing brace which is causing a syntax error. We need to add braces around the else statement so that both if and else have their own blocks.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Step-by-step explanation:
- The original code has `else b = 2; }` which misses the opening curly brace for the else block.
- We add `{ b = 2; }` after else to properly enclose the else statement.

The fixed code is:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
