Thinking...
Okay, so I need to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let's look at the code provided:

if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Hmm, I remember that in many programming languages like C or Java, when you have an if statement with multiple conditions, each condition is separated by a comma and followed by braces for the block. But here, it looks different.

Wait, the code has "if (x > 0) [ ... ] else b = 2; ]". I think in some languages, people use square brackets instead of curly braces. Maybe that's what's intended here. So the structure is if (...) [ { ... } ] else ...

Looking at the code inside: a = 1; and then there's an else statement with b=2;. But after the first block, there's a closing bracket, which might be causing the syntax error.

So perhaps the code should have curly braces for both blocks. Let me break it down:

The original code is:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

I think the issue is that after the first part, there's an extra bracket and then the else statement outside of any block. So maybe I need to adjust the braces.

Let me try rewriting it:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This way, each condition has its own curly brace block. The square brackets in the original code might not be recognized as block delimiters correctly by the compiler or interpreter, hence causing a syntax error.

So I'll replace the square brackets with curly braces for both the if and else parts. That should fix the syntax issue.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
