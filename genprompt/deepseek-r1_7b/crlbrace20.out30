Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code here that's supposed to be fixed. The user mentioned a syntax error, and they want me to use only the information from the error message without any pre-trained knowledge beyond what's in it. Let me take a look at the code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, first thing I notice is that this looks like an if-else statement. In most programming languages, each condition inside an if or else block needs to have proper indentation and structure.

The error message says there's a syntax error. Syntax errors usually occur when the code doesn't follow the language's rules. Let me check for any obvious issues here.

Looking at the code, after the if statement, we have `{ a = 1; }` which is correct inside an else block. But then I see `else b = 2; }`. Wait, that seems off because in an else clause, you typically don't close the else part with the same curly brace. In most languages like C or Java, the structure would be:

```
if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
   // code
}
```

So in this case, the else block should have its own braces, but here it's written as `else b = 2; }` which is actually not correct. The user's code has two closing curly braces: one after the if condition and another at the end of the line. That might be causing a syntax error because the second brace isn't properly associated with an else statement.

Wait, no, looking again, the code inside the if block is `a = 1;` with its own curly brace `{}`, but then the else part starts with `else b = 2;` and ends with `}`. But where did that second `}` come from? Let me count the braces.

The original code has:
- The first line: `if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }`

So, let's break it down:

1. `if (x > 0)` - that's fine.
2. `{ a = 1; }` - this is the if block with proper braces.
3. Then there's an `else`, which in most languages starts an else block.
4. So after `else`, we should have a new block, like `{ b = 2; }`.

But in the given code, it's written as `else b = 2; }` without any opening brace for the else part. That might be causing a syntax error because the else statement isn't properly closed or associated with an open brace.

Wait, but let me check: after the if block's closing brace, there's another `}` at the end of the line. So the structure is:

- `if (x > 0) { ... } else b = 2; }`

So that would mean after the else statement ends with a }, which might not be necessary because in most languages, if you have an else without any block, it's allowed but only when it's followed by nothing or another condition. But in this case, perhaps the code is trying to write `else b = 2; }` and then another }, causing a mismatch.

Alternatively, maybe the initial mistake is that the else part isn't properly enclosed within braces. Let me think: in the user's code, after the if block's closing brace `{}`, there's an else statement followed by a semicolon and then a closing brace again. So it would look like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; }
else b = 2;
}
```

Wait, that might not be correct because the else should have its own block. So perhaps the code is missing braces for the else part.

But wait, maybe in this context, the user's syntax isn't standard, but given that they mentioned it could be different from languages like C, Java, or Python, I need to consider how they're using curly braces and semicolons.

Another thing I notice is that after `else`, there's no opening brace before writing `b = 2;`. That would cause a syntax error because else needs to have its own block. So the correct structure should be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But in the user's code, they didn't include the opening braces for each block after `if` and `else`. Also, there are two closing braces at the end, which might be causing an extra brace that doesn't match anything.

So putting it together:

The original code has:
- The if statement correctly opened with `{ a = 1; }`
- Then else followed by `b = 2;` and another `}`

This would result in an invalid syntax because after the if block's closing }, there's an else without any block, which might be allowed in some languages but perhaps not here. Alternatively, the extra brace at the end could cause a problem.

So to fix it:

1. Remove the extra closing brace at the very end so that we don't have two }'s after the else.
2. Add opening and closing braces for each statement inside if and else blocks.

Wait, but looking again, in some languages like JavaScript or maybe others, you can write an else without a block, but it's rare. It's more common to have else with a block. So perhaps adding braces around both the if and else statements would fix any potential issues.

So the corrected code should be:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

But wait, in some languages, you can have just `else;` with no block. But since the user's error message is about syntax, perhaps adding braces for each statement would be safer.

Alternatively, if the code doesn't need to add braces because it's a single statement per line, maybe that's not necessary. Let me check:

In some languages like Ruby or JavaScript, you can have an else without any block by just writing `else;` but in others, especially those where statements require blocks (like Java), you must have curly braces.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps adding braces for each statement is safer to avoid syntax errors.

So putting it all together, I'll adjust the code by adding braces around both the if and else parts. Also, ensure that there's only one closing brace at the very end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```
