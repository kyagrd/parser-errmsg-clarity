Thinking...
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message is just a "syntax error," which usually means there's something wrong with the structure of the code. Let me look at the code provided:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, so I see an if-else statement here. The code inside the if block is `a = 1;` and then there's an else followed by `b = 2;`. But wait, this doesn't look right.

First, I notice that the closing brace for the if statement isn't properly placed. In most programming languages, each block needs to have its own braces correctly matched. Here, after the if condition, the code has `{ a = 1; } else b = 2; }`. It looks like there are two closing braces at the end: one from the if block and another extra one.

Let me break it down:

- The if statement starts with `if (x > 0) {` which is correct.
- Inside the brace, we have `{ a = 1; }`, so that's fine.
- Then comes `else b = 2;` – wait, the else should be followed by another block enclosed in braces. So after the else, there should be `{ b = 2; }`. But looking at the code, it just has `b = 2;` without a closing brace before the final `}`.

Also, I see that the code ends with two closing braces: one from the if and another extra one at the end. That's definitely causing a syntax error because each opening brace must have a corresponding closing brace.

So to fix this, I need to adjust the placement of the braces. The else statement should be part of the same if block but within its own braces. Let me rewrite it:

The correct structure should be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

This way, each brace is properly closed after its respective statements. I removed the extra closing brace at the end and added braces around both the if block and the else block to ensure proper syntax.

I should check if this fixes the issue. The code now has one opening brace for the if statement and two closing braces—one inside the if block, another inside the else block, and finally the outermost closing brace. Wait, no, that's three braces which is wrong because each opening needs a corresponding closing.

Wait, actually, in my corrected version, I have:

1. The initial `if (x > 0) {` – one opening brace.
2. Inside, `{ a = 1; }` – another opening and closing.
3. Then `} else { b = 2; }` – here, the else is followed by an opening brace for the second block, then inside it has `b=2;` and closes with `}`, and finally closes the outer if statement.

Wait, no, I think I got confused. Let me recount:

In the corrected code:
- The first line after the if condition is `{ a = 1; }` – that's one opening and closing brace.
- Then comes `} else { b = 2; }` – so here, the outer if statement has its own closing brace at the end.

Wait no, actually:

The code should be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
}
else {
    b = 2;
}
```

So each block inside the if-else is properly enclosed. That way, there are two opening braces after the initial if and one final closing brace at the end of else's block.

Wait, no. Let me count:

Line 1: `if (x > 0) {` – opening brace.
Line 2: `    a = 1;`
Line 3: `}` – closing brace for line 1.
Line 4: `else {` – another opening brace.
Line 5: `    b = 2;`
Line 6: `}` – closing brace for line 4.
Line 7: `}` – but this is not needed because the else block already has its own closing. Wait, no, in some languages, you can write it without an explicit final brace if there's only one statement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with how braces work here. Let me think again.

The original code had two closing braces at the end: after `a=1;` and then another `}`. So that was wrong because each opening must have a corresponding closing.

So in my corrected version, I should make sure that each opening brace has exactly one closing. The initial if statement starts with `{`, so it needs to close before moving on to the else part.

Wait, no. Actually, the code is structured as:

if (x > 0) { ... } else {...};

But in reality, in most languages, you have to enclose each block within its own braces. So the correct way is:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

This ensures that both statements are properly enclosed within their respective blocks.

So putting it all together, I need to adjust the code by adding braces around each statement after if and else. That should fix the syntax error.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
