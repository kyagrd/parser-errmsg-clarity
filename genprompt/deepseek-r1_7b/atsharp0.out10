Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. The error message just says "syntax error," which is pretty vague, but let me look at the code provided and see what's wrong.

The code is:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

Hmm, I know that in programming, especially in languages like C or Python with conditional expressions, we have specific syntax rules. The line starts with an `if` statement, which usually ends with a colon and then has an indented block. But here, after the `if` condition, there's an `@` symbol followed by `a = 1;`. That doesn't look right.

Wait, maybe this is in a language that uses both `if` statements and expressions? Like C. In C, you can have inline conditional operators using the ternary operator, which looks like `condition ? expr1 : expr2`. So perhaps there's a mix-up here between an actual `if` block and the ternary operator.

Looking at the code again: after the `if (x > 0)`, it has `@ a = 1;` but in C, the ternary operator is `?`, not `@`. So this might be a typo. The correct syntax would probably use `?:` instead of `@`.

Also, I notice that there are some `#` signs at the end. In Python, those are used for comments or imports, but in other languages like C, they can also be used to comment out lines if they start with `#`. But here, they might not belong and could be causing issues.

So putting it all together, I think the line is trying to use a ternary operator but has incorrect syntax. The fix would be replacing `@` with `?:`, which is how the ternary operator works in C. Also, removing the trailing comments since they're unnecessary at the end of the statement.

Wait, another thing: after an `if` statement without braces, you can only have one statement, but if it's part of a larger expression, maybe using parentheses could help. Alternatively, perhaps wrapping everything in parentheses would make it clearer and avoid syntax issues.

So I'll adjust the code to use parentheses around the entire ternary operation. That way, the structure is clear: an `if` condition followed by two expressions separated by `?:`, which makes it a valid expression rather than a statement.

Putting it all together, the corrected line should be:

```
if (x > 0) ? (a = 1) : (b = 2);
```

This way, when x is greater than 0, it assigns 1 to a, otherwise 2 to b. Also, I removed the trailing comments since they're not needed at the end of the statement.

I think that should fix the syntax error by correctly using the ternary operator and removing unnecessary parts.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) ? (a = 1) : (b = 2);
```
