Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the code provided. The user mentioned that the error is a syntax error and gave me some code to work with. Let's see what I have here.

The code given is:
```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

Hmm, right away, I notice something seems off because of the brackets and semicolons. The error message just says "syntax error," which means there's an issue with how the code is structured.

Looking at the if statement: `if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]`. Wait, after the if condition, they have square brackets `[` instead of parentheses. In many programming languages, like C or Java, you use parentheses for conditionals, so that might be an issue.

Then, inside the if block, it's `a = 1;` which is fine on its own, but then there's a closing bracket `]` after it. But why are they using square brackets here? Maybe that's causing confusion because in some contexts, square brackets can denote arrays or function calls, not conditionals.

Next, the else part: `else b = 2; ]`. Again, ending with a semicolon and then another closing bracket before the semicolon at the end. This looks off because it's missing an operator between 'else' and whatever comes next. Also, after 'else', there should be something like 'b = 2;' but in this code, instead of that, we have `[` which is probably causing a syntax error.

Wait, perhaps they intended to write the else statement differently. Maybe they wanted to use a different structure without brackets for the conditionals. Let me think about how other languages handle it. For example, in JavaScript or Python, you would write `if (x > 0):` with colons and then an indented block.

But in this code, they're using square brackets around the if statement and another after else. Maybe that's incorrect because those should be parentheses instead of brackets. Also, the placement of the semicolons is off. In many languages, you end the statement before the next one, but here it seems like there are extra brackets causing syntax issues.

So perhaps I need to replace all square brackets with parentheses and adjust where the semicolons go. Let me try rewriting that.

Original code structure:
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]

Proposed fix: Change the square brackets around 'if' into parentheses, so it becomes if (x > 0). Then, in the else block, remove the extra bracket. So after fixing, it should be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

But wait, in the original code, they have semicolons at the end of each line and then another closing bracket before the final semicolon. Maybe I can structure it without those extra brackets.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write an if-else statement where both branches are single-line statements, so using { } around them is unnecessary but acceptable in some languages like C or JavaScript.

So putting it all together, replacing square brackets with parentheses and adjusting semicolons should fix the syntax error. That way, each block inside the if and else will end correctly without mismatched brackets.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
