Thinking...
Alright, let me try to figure out how to fix this syntax error in the given code. The user provided an error message saying "syntax error" and some code that doesn't look right. 

First, I'll look at the code they gave:
```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```
Hmm, okay. So there's an if statement here with a condition `x > 0`. Then it has something that looks like `@a = 1` and in the else part, `else b = 2`. But wait, I remember that in programming languages like C or C++, you can't just put an @ symbol before a variable. That's probably where the syntax error is coming from.

Looking closer, maybe they meant to use an operator here. Perhaps it's supposed to be some sort of bitwise operation? The `@` symbol isn't valid in that context. So I'm thinking, what if instead of `@a`, it should be something like `a & 1` where `&` is the bitwise AND operator?

Also, there are these comments at the end: `# else b = 2; #`. Wait, those look like C-style comments because they start with a `//`. But in this context, maybe the user intended to have an if-else statement without any comments. So perhaps those lines shouldn't be there.

Putting it all together, I think the code was trying to write an if-else block where inside each condition, some bitwise operation is performed on variable `a` and `b`. The `@` was a mistake, so replacing that with `&` would fix the syntax error. Also, removing the commented lines makes sense since they're not necessary for the code's functionality.

So the corrected code should be:
```
if (x > 0) {
    a & = 1;
} else {
    b & = 2;
}
```
I added braces `{}` around each block to make it more standard, which is good practice and probably necessary if this code is part of a larger program. It ensures that the statements inside are properly scoped.

Also, I changed `@a` to `a & =1;` because in C/C++, you assign after using an operator. So instead of `a & 1`, it's better to write `a & = 1`. This is a common mistake but important for correct syntax and functionality.

So yeah, by replacing the `@` with `&=` and properly structuring the if-else block with braces, the code should now compile without errors. I think that's all there is to it based on the error message provided.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a & =1; } else { b & =2; }
```
