Thinking...
Alright, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in the given code. Let me look at the problem step by step.

The user provided an error message: "unexpected ']' after else clause (if statement already closed)". Hmm, that sounds like a mismatched bracket issue somewhere.

Looking at the code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else b = 2; ]
```

I notice there are square brackets around `a=1` and then another one before the semicolon after `else`. Normally, in JavaScript or similar languages, we use curly braces `{}` for blocks. So using square brackets here is probably incorrect.

Wait, maybe they intended to write an array or something else with brackets, but it's not necessary there. Let me check where the brackets are placed.

The first part is `(x > 0) [ a = 1; ]` – that seems odd because after the condition in `if`, we usually have `{}` for code blocks. So replacing `[ ]` with `{ }` might fix it.

Then, after the else clause, there's another `]`. That extra bracket is causing the error because there shouldn't be a closing bracket right there since the if statement is already closed.

So putting it all together: change the square brackets to curly braces in the first part and remove the trailing square bracket at the end. The corrected code should look like:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

This way, each block is properly enclosed with `{}` and there are no extra brackets causing syntax issues.
...done thinking.

The error occurs because of mismatched square brackets in the if statement. The correct syntax uses curly braces for blocks.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2;
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Replaced `[ ]` with `{ }` around `a = 1` as square brackets are not used for code blocks.
2. Removed the trailing square bracket `]` at the end since it was causing an unexpected error and unnecessary.

The corrected code no longer has syntax errors related to mismatched brackets.
