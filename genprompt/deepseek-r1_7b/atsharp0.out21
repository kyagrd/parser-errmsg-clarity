Thinking...
Okay, so I have this code that has a syntax error. Let me look at it carefully. The code is:

if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

Hmm, I'm seeing an if statement here with some operators and variables. Wait, the line starts with "if (x > 0)" which looks correct for a condition in an if statement. Then there's "@ a = 1;" followed by "# else b = 2; #". That seems odd.

I remember that in programming, especially in languages like C or C++, the @ symbol isn't used as an operator. It might be part of a preprocessor directive, but here it's probably causing a syntax error because it's not valid in that context.

Looking at how if statements are usually structured: there's the condition, then the body, and after the closing parenthesis, sometimes you have braces or other structures like else. But I don't think "else" is being used correctly here with @ symbols.

Wait, maybe the person meant to use a ternary operator? Ternary operators in some languages look like this: (condition) ? value1 : value2; So perhaps they intended something like that.

But looking at their code, it's written as if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2; #

The '#' symbols are probably not part of the code and might be causing issues or just placeholders. Or maybe they're using some sort of comment markers incorrectly.

So, putting this together, I think the main issue is the use of '@' instead of something like a ternary operator. Maybe replacing @ with '?' would fix it. So the corrected line should be if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2; 

Also, removing the '#' symbols because they're not needed here. They might have been added by mistake or for some other purpose, but in this context, they don't serve any function and are causing confusion.

So, combining all that, the fixed code should replace '@' with '?' and remove the '#'s. The corrected line becomes:

if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;

I think that's it. That way, if x is greater than zero, a gets set to 1; else, b gets set to 2. This should resolve the syntax error and make the code function as intended.
...done thinking.

The code has a syntax error due to an invalid operator '@'. The correct approach is to replace '@' with the ternary operator '?'.

Here's the fixed code:

```c
if (x > 0) ? a = 1 : b = 2;
```

This line now correctly evaluates whether `x` is greater than zero and assigns values accordingly.
