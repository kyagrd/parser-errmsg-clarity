Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to fix this syntax error in a code snippet. The error message says there's an unexpected '}' after the else clause, which means the if statement already closed. Let me look at the code again:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }
```

Hmm, I notice that the code starts with an if statement that has curly braces: `{ a = 1; }`. Then there's an else clause followed by `b = 2;`, and after that another closing brace. So, it looks like we have two sets of curly braces here.

Wait, in most programming languages, each control structure should be properly closed with its own braces. The if statement is enclosed within one set, but then the else part seems to be using a different set without matching them correctly.

Let me break it down:

1. The if condition: `if (x > 0) {` - this is correct because we have an opening brace.
2. Inside the if block: `a = 1;` - that's fine.
3. Then, after the closing brace of the if statement, there's an else clause: `else b = 2; }` - but wait, this else isn't properly associated with the if. The structure here is incorrect because the braces aren't matching.

I think the issue is that the code has two separate if-else blocks without proper nesting or alignment. The first part correctly uses an if statement with its braces, and then there's another else statement outside of it but also with a brace. So, the compiler gets confused about which braces belong to what.

The error message points out that after the else clause, there's an unexpected '}', implying that the structure is mismatched. So, perhaps I should adjust the braces so that each if-else pair has its own set of braces.

Wait, no, in this case, it's just a single if statement with an else part. The code might be trying to write something like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But the original code doesn't have the second set of braces around the else block. Instead, it has `else b = 2; }` which is causing an extra closing brace.

So, to fix this, I should add curly braces after the else statement so that both cases are properly enclosed. Let me see:

The current structure is:

if (x>0) { a=1; } else b=2; }

Which has two separate blocks: one for if and another for else without braces around else.

So, to fix it, I should add the opening brace after else so that the else statement is within its own curly braces. That way, each part of the code (if and else) will have their respective braces, making the structure correct.

Therefore, the corrected code would be:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

This adds an opening brace after else so that it's enclosed within its own block. Now, each if-else part has matching braces, and there are no extra closing braces.

I should also check the syntax to ensure all braces are correctly matched. In this case, adding the opening brace after else makes everything properly closed at the end.
...done thinking.

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
