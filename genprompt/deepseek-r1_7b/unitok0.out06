Thinking...
Okay, so I've got this code here that's supposed to fix a syntax error. The user provided both the original code and an error message saying there's a syntax error. My task is to figure out what's wrong with the code and correct it using only the information from the error message and without any pre-trained knowledge.

Let me start by looking at the original code:

if (x > 0) 《 a = 1; 》 else b = 2; 》

Hmm, I notice that there are some characters like 《 and 》 which look like they might be part of a markup language, maybe HTML or something similar. But in this context, it's probably being used to represent code formatting without actual content.

Looking at the structure, the if-else statement is supposed to have two conditions: one where x is greater than 0 and another where it isn't. So normally, an if-else block would look like:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

But in the given code, instead of using curly braces {}, it's using these symbols 《 and 》 which are probably placeholders for formatting. So the actual code without the placeholders is missing some syntax.

Wait, I see that after the if condition, there's a semicolon with 《 a = 1; 》. That might be an issue because in JavaScript or other languages, each statement should end with a semicolon. But more importantly, inside the if block, you need to have curly braces to enclose the statements.

So the code is written as:

if (x > 0) [something] else b = 2;

But without proper braces, it's trying to write two separate statements within one condition, which isn't valid. So maybe instead of using 《 and 》 for formatting, they should be replaced with actual syntax.

Putting it all together, the code inside the triple backticks is actually:

if (x > 0) a = 1; else b = 2;

But this is missing the curly braces around the if block. So to fix this, I need to add { after if and } after the closing else.

So the corrected code should be:

if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}

Therefore, in the triple backquotes without the placeholders, it would look like:

if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }

That should fix the syntax error because now each block is properly enclosed within curly braces.
...done thinking.

The code has missing curly braces around the if-else statements. Adding them fixes the syntax.

```fix
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
