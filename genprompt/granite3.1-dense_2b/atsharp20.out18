```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

[Explanation] The error message suggests there is a syntax error, but no specific details about the type of syntax error are provided. In this context, I've assumed that the issue might be related to missing semicolons or incorrect indentation in some languages like JavaScript. Therefore, I added semicolons at the end of each statement to correct potential issues with these.
