Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

The correction involves removing the extra closing bracket ']' that was present outside the if statement. In JavaScript, you need to use curly braces {} to indicate the start and end of an if block, so I replaced the [ brackets with {} instead.
