Here's the corrected code with the syntax error fixed:

```
if (x > 0) {
  a = 1;
} else {
  b = 2;
}
```

The issue was that the closing brace "}" was missing after the if-else statement, and the curly braces were placed outside the correct scope. The corrected code now has proper indentation and bracing to maintain valid syntax.
