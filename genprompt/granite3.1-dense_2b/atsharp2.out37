```
if (x > 0) @a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

[Note: In this context, I've assumed that the code is written in a language similar to C or C-like languages, as it mentions an assignment after the 'else' clause. The syntax error indicates that the '#' symbol should not be placed immediately after the 'else' clause. By removing the '#', the code maintains its intended flow.]
