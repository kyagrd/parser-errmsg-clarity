```
if (x > 0) a = 1; # else b = 2; #
```

The given code has a syntax error due to the use of an equal sign (=) without a variable or value on its right side, which is not valid in most programming languages. I've replaced it with a semicolon (;) to indicate the start of a new statement, as this is typically allowed in many languages like C and JavaScript. The fix assumes the original intent was to assign values based on a condition, so I used semicolons to separate statements within the if-else block.
