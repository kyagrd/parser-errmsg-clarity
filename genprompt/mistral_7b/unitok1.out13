 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

In the original code, you were missing curly braces ({}) to enclose the statements for each branch of the `if` statement. The corrected code now has these braces, which properly enclose the statements within each branch.
