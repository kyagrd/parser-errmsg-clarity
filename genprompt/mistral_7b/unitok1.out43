 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

I used curly braces to enclose the statements for both the `if` and `else` clauses. This corrects the syntax error by grouping together related code lines, allowing the compiler to understand where each block starts and ends.
