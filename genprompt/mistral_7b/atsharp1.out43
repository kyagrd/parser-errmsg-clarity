 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

By moving the `else b = 2` after the closing semicolon of the if statement, we've resolved the syntax error. The '#' symbol was causing the issue because it is not a recognized command or operator in this context. In many scripting languages, including Bash, '#' is used as a comment marker and should not appear within the logic flow of the code.
