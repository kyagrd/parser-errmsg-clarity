 Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ];
```

In your original code, the semicolon after the `else` clause was causing the error since it closed the if statement prematurely. I removed the extra semicolon and added brackets around the statements associated with each branch of the `if-else` statement to resolve the issue.
