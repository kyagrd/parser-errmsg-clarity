 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

The issue in your original code was that you were missing curly braces to properly define the scope for both if and else blocks. In C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and many other programming languages, it's important to use curly braces even with a single line inside the blocks to avoid such syntax errors.
