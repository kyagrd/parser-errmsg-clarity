 Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue in your original code was that the `else` keyword needed to be paired with a set of curly braces to define its own block, similar to how the `if` block is defined. I also added the missing curly brace after the `else` statement for proper indentation.
