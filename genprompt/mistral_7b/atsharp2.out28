 ```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

The '#' symbol should be removed from before 'else', as it is causing the syntax error by being interpreted as a comment starting point, but there is no closing comment symbol (#). Hence, the corrected code should look like this:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```
