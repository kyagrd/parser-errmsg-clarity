 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

In your original code, there was a missing `{` for the else clause and an extra `}` which caused the error. The corrected code includes braces around both the if statement and the else statement to ensure they are properly matched.
