 ```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
I added curly braces around the if-else statement and also added curly braces for the `else` block to make it syntactically correct in many programming languages such as C, Java, C++, and JavaScript. The correct code is now:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
