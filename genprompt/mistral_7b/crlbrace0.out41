 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue in your original code was that there was no curly brace to close the `else` statement. In this corrected version, I added another set of braces to correctly group the statements inside the `if` and `else` conditions.
