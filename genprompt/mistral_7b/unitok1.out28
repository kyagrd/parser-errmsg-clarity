 Here's the corrected version of your code, fixing the syntax error:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The key change is using curly braces `{}` to properly enclose the blocks within both `if` and `else` statements. This allows for multiple lines of code within each block, resolving the unexpected '》' error.
