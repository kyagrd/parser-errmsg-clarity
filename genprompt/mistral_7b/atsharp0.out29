 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

I made two changes to your original code:
1. Enclosed the entire conditional statement in curly braces `{}`.
2. Removed the semicolons (`;`) before and after the condition blocks, as they are not necessary in this context.
