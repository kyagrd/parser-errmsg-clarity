 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

In your original code, you forgot to wrap the condition and its actions inside curly braces `{}`. This fixes the unexpected symbol '》' error by replacing it with the correct syntax for if-else statements in C++ or similar languages.
