 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

In the original code, there was a missing curly brace `}` after the `else` clause which caused the syntax error. The corrected version includes that brace to properly group statements within both the `if` and `else` blocks.
