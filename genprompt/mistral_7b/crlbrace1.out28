 Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue was that you were missing braces for the `else` clause, and also there was an extra closing brace at the end. By enclosing both parts of the if-else statement in curly braces, we ensure they are correctly matched.
