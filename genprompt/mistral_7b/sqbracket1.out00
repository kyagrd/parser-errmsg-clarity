 Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) [ a = 1; ] else [ b = 2; ];
```

In this corrected version, I have added square brackets for the else clause to enclose the statement `b = 2;`. This fixes the syntax error caused by an unmatched or misplaced closing bracket in your original code.
