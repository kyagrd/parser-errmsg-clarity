 Here is the corrected code with the syntax error fixed:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else { b = 2 };
```

In the original code, I replaced the unexpected '》' character and added curly braces to correct the indentation and grouping of the statements within the `if` and `else` clauses. Additionally, semicolons were added to ensure proper termination of each statement in C-like languages such as JavaScript and Java.
