 Here is the fixed version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

In your original code, you forgot to include curly braces `{}` after the `else`, which resulted in a syntax error. By adding these braces and enclosing the code that should execute when the condition is false within them, the error is corrected.
