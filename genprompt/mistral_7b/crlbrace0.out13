 ```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
In this case, I corrected the syntax error by adding curly braces `{}` to enclose both the conditional expression and the `else` statement, as well as fixing the indentation. This ensures that the code is correctly structured and should compile without errors.
