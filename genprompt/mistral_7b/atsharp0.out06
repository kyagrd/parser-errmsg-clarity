 Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; c = 3; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue in your original code was that you were missing curly braces `{}` to enclose the statements within the `if` and `else` blocks, and also there was an extra semicolon after the `a = 1; c = 3;` line which is not needed.
