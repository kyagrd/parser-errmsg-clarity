 Here's the fixed code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue in the original code was missing curly braces `{}` to enclose the actions for each conditional statement, making it difficult to understand where the blocks begin and end. By adding these braces, we ensure that the syntax is correct.
