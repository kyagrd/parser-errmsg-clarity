 Here is the corrected version of your code with the syntax error fixed:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue in the original code was that the `else` statement didn't have a corresponding curly brace to define its block. In this corrected version, I added a curly brace after the `else` statement to enclose the code for the "else" branch.
