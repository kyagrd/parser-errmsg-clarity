 Here is the corrected code with the syntax error fixed:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
In the original code, there was a missing curly brace before the `else` statement, which is causing the error. In the corrected version, I've added that missing brace to enclose the statements following the `else`.
