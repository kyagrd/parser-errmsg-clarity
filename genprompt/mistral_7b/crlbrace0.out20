 Here's the corrected version of your code with the syntax error fixed:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue was that you forgot to include braces `{}` for the `else` statement, making it difficult for the compiler to understand where the code block for the `else` condition should start and end. Now the corrected version has proper bracing, and it should work as expected!
