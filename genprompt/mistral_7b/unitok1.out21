 Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else { b = 2 };
```

The changes made are:
- I added curly braces `{}` to enclose the statements within the `if` and `else` blocks.
- I replaced the `》` with semicolons `;`, as they are used to separate statements in most programming languages.
