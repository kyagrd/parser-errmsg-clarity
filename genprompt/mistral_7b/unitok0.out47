 Here's the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0)
    a = 1;
else
    b = 2;
```

I removed the extraneous semicolons that were causing the syntax error in your original code. In C and C-like languages, semicolons are used to end statements, but they should not appear before the opening brace or after the closing brace of a block of code.
