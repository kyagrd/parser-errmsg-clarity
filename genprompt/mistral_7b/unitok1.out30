 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else { b = 2 };
```

In this corrected version, I replaced the unexpected `》` with curly braces `{}` and ensured that both branches of the if-else statement are wrapped inside these braces. Additionally, I changed the single quotes surrounding `a = 1;` to open curly braces as well to maintain proper syntax for code blocks.
