 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1 } else { b = 2 };
```

The issue with your original code was that it didn't have proper curly braces for if-else blocks, and also it used unrecognized symbols '》'. In the corrected version, I've replaced those symbols with standard curly braces `{}`, and the code should now work correctly.
