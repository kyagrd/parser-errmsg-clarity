 Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

In the original code, I noticed that curly braces were missing after the `else` clause. The corrected version includes them. By using the braces, we ensure that both branches of the if-else statement have their own scope.
