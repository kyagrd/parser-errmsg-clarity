 Here's the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; # else b = 2;
```

By removing the semicolon after the `else`, it should resolve the error as the error message suggests that the '#' symbol is unexpected after the `else` clause, which is closed by the semicolon. However, since the syntax might be different from existing languages, this correction assumes the language used in the original code follows a similar syntax to C or Python.
