 Here's the corrected code with the syntax error addressed:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
#else b = 2;
```

By separating the `#else` directive and its corresponding statement, the if-else block is properly formed. The hash symbol (#) can be used to define comments in some programming languages like Bash but should not appear within conditional statements.
