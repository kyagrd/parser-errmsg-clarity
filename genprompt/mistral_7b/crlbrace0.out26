 ```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

Here's what I did to fix the syntax error:

1. Added curly braces `{}` after the `else` statement, as it is required when there are multiple statements inside the `if` and `else` blocks.
2. Corrected the indentation to match the opening `if` statement for readability purposes.
