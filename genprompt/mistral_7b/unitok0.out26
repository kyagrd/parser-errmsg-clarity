 Here's the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue in your original code was missing curly braces `{}` to define the scope of the if-else block, and semicolons after each statement inside the if and else blocks are not necessary unless they are followed by another statement on the same line.
