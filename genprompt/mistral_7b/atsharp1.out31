 Here is the corrected code with the syntax error fixed:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1;
else b = 2;
```

The issue was that the `#` symbol should not have been used after the `else` clause as it is not a valid syntax construct for if statements. Instead, the semicolon (`;`) should be used to separate different statements on the same line in C-like languages.
