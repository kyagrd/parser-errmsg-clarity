 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The issue was that there was an extra closing curly brace `}` after the `else` clause, which should be removed and the opening curly brace for the `else` statement needs to have a matching closing brace. I also added the missing curly braces for the `if` statement since it's good practice to always include them even if there's only one line of code inside the condition or else clause.
