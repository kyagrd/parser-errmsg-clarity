 ```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```
In this fix, I've used curly braces `{}` to enclose the statements within the if and else clauses to make them blocks of code instead of single statements. This solves the error caused by using the `》` symbol, which is not a valid syntax in most programming languages for closing blocks or statements.
