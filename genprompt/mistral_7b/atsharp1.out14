 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

The '#' symbol is used for comments in some programming languages, but it should not be used after the 'else' clause as it was in the provided code. The correction removes the '#' and places the comment elsewhere or removes it altogether if not needed.
