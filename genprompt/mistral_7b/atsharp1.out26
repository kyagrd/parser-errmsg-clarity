 Here is the corrected version of your code, with the removed unnecessary comments and hashes:

```
if (x > 0) @ a = 1; else b = 2;
```

However, I'd like to mention that this code may not be valid depending on the programming language you are using. This example is assuming a syntax closer to SQL or shell scripting languages. If it is for another language, such as C++ or Python, the corrected version would look different.
