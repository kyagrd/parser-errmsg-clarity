 Here's the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

I replaced the `》` with curly braces `{}` and indentated the statements within each block using proper indentation, as well as adding a semicolon before the closing `》`. This code should now be syntactically correct.
