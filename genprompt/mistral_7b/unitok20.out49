 Here is the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else { b = 2; }
```

The main issue in the original code was the lack of curly braces `{}` to enclose the statements within each condition of the `if-else` statement. In many programming languages, these are required for multi-line commands or when there is more than one command in an `if` or `else` block.
