```python

if x > 0:

    a = 1


else:

    b = 2

```

Note: The original code appears to be written with syntax resembling Python's `exec()` function but is not valid for regular variable assignment or conditional statements in standard programming languages like C, Java, and others. I have translated it into correct Python syntax within the context of a typical if-else structure.

```python

if x > 0:

    'a' = 1


elif x <= 0: # Assuming there was supposed to be an else condition for completeness as suggested by "@" symbol which is not valid in standard programming languages.

    'b' = 2

```

However, given the provided error message and original code context hinting towards a language with '@', I will maintain Python-like syntax:

```python

if x > 0: # Removed invalid characters at start of line (e.g., '#')

    a = 1


elif not x > 0: # Assuming there was supposed to be an else condition for completeness as suggested by "@" symbol which is not valid in standard programming languages.

    b = 2

```
