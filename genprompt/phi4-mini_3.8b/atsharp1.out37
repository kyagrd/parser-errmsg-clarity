```cpp
if (x > 0)
{
    // Code for when x is greater than zero.
}
else
{
    // Fix: Remove '#' and add missing braces to complete the if-else statement syntax correctly.
    b = 2;
}
```

Note that I removed `@` which was unnecessary, assuming it might have been a typo or an editor-specific artifact. The comment indicates where additional code should be placed for clarity; actual functional statements would depend on context not provided in your snippet.

The original line with the '#' symbol after else clause has also mistakenly included another '#' at the end of what looks like double-quoted string ('#'), which was likely a typo or mistyped character. I've removed those and properly indented to reflect standard C/C++ syntax for an if-else statement block in this context.

Remember that actual code should be written with correct indentation, use semicolons appropriately (though not needed at the end of statements when using braces), variable declarations (`a`, `b` need declaring first before assignment unless they are already declared somewhere else outside these snippets and initialized earlier on if necessary) to make it fully functional. The comment suggests that there might be additional code missing which would also have an impact in a real-world scenario.

```cpp
if (x > 0)
{
    // Code for when x is greater than zero.
}
else
{
    b = 2;
}
```

The `a` variable was not assigned any value within the if block and it wasn't declared outside of this snippet. If it's supposed to change its state based on some conditions, additional context would be needed (i.e., declaration prior or other conditional logic).
