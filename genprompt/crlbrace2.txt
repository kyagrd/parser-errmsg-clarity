Fix the syntax error in the code below using ONLY the error message, without using the pre-trained knowledge.

Error message:
unexpected '}' after else clause (if statement already closed)

Code:
```
if (x > 0) { a = 1; } else b = 2; }

```

Output ONLY the fixed code inside the triple backquote code block.
Note the syntax of the code above may be DIFFERENT from exsting languages,
such as C, Java, Python, etc. Try to fix the error using symbols that
appear in the error message, if available.
DO NOT output your "thinking" process. ONLY output wat was asked.
