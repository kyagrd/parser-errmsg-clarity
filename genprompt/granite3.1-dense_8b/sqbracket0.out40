Here's the corrected code:

```
if (x > 0) {
    a = 1;
} else {
    b = 2;
}
```

Explanation: The error in the original code was that it lacked proper syntax for the conditional statement `if-else`. Each condition and its corresponding action should be enclosed within curly braces `{}` to form a block. Additionally, each condition (in this case, `x > 0`) should be followed by a colon `:`, and the code blocks should be separated by semicolons `;`.
